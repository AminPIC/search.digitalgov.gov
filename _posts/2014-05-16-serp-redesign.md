[Bing](http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/17/bing-reveals-its-redesign-and-latest-improvements/){% external_link %}, [Google](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027704/how-googles-redesigned-search-results-augur-a-more-beautiful-web){% external_link %}, and [Yahoo](http://mashable.com/2013/06/05/yahoo-redesigns-its-search-page/){% external_link %} have all rolled out major redesigns to their search results pages in the past year.

The last time we did a major redesign of our results page was in January 2012. It was long overdue for a facelift.

So, we've redesigned our search results page. We've kept an eye on best practices in the search industry and what media websites (like NPR.org and NYTimes.com) are up to, But, we're not simply following the leaders. We've also [analyzed our search data](http://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/07/analyzing-search-data-in-real-time-to-drive-decisions/) to make data-driven decisions that, ultimately, aim to make searchers' experience better on your site.

Below are some of the highlights.

## Basic Search Results

We started with the basic search results because they're the meat of the page. They also have the highest clickthru rate among the various items shown on the page. Here's the before and after for a search on *passport* on USA.gov.

![Search result for passport on USA.gov](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-search-result.png "Search result for passport on USA.gov")

We've done away with the underlining on the title. The snippet is wider and has more space. Clicking or touching anywhere on the snippet (not just the title) opens the link.

## Spelling Suggestions

Spelling suggestions have the second highest clickthru rate so we focused on those next. Here's the before and after for a search on *manual noriega* (sic) on USA.gov.

![Spelling suggestion for manual noriega (sic) on USA.gov](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-spelling.png "Spelling suggestion for manual noriega (sic) on USA.gov")

We've done away with the wordiness and boldface. The suggestion and its corresponding option to override the automatic correction now use plain language and are shown on two lines. We now only use boldface to highlight keyword matches for searchers' queries.

## Search Verticals

Here's the before and after for a search on *jobs* on USA.gov.

![Search verticals on USA.gov](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-verticals.png "Search verticals on USA.gov")

The new format clusters all options to narrow, broaden, or change the scope of the results together, and places these options directly above the search box. It also shows up to three options with ability to show More &hellip;. The old format placed verticals in the left-hand column below the box and the option to search on related sites in the right-hand column above the box.

## Videos

Here's the before and after for a search on *careers* on USA.gov.

![Video search result for careers on USA.gov](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-video.png "Video search result for careers on USA.gov")

The new video format shows one video plus a clearly labeled "More videos about ..." link. It also shows the video's source (in this case YouTube), the length of the video, and a short snippet. The video is now separated from basic search results by thin grey lines.

## Tweets

Here's the before and after for a search on *social security* on USA.gov.

![Tweet for social security on USA.gov](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-tweet.png "Tweet for social security on USA.gov")

The new tweet format shows one tweet inline with the results. It now shows the agency's Twitter profile image and the tweet is separated from basic search results by thin grey lines and doesn't have a separate heading. Searchers now see tweets from the last three days only. (It used to be 30 days.) The old format showed tweets in a right-hand column that was often mistaken for an ad.

## Job Openings

Here's the before and after for a search on *communications jobs* on USA.gov.

![Job results for communications jobs on USA.gov](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-jobs.png "Job results for communications jobs on USA.gov")

The new job opening format shows one up to three job openings inline with the results. Searchers can now click or touch the down arrow to see up to 10 listings inline. For federal agencies, it now shows the USAJobs logo to clearly identify that as the data source. The job openings are separated from basic search results by thin grey lines. The old format showed jobs in a right-hand column that was often mistaken for an ad and didn't give searchers the option to see more listings on the results page.

## Health Topics

Here's the before and after for a search on *diabetes* on USA.gov.

![Health topic result for diabetes on USA.gov](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-health-govbox.png "Health topic result for diabetes on USA.gov")

The new health topics format shows a shorter, more concise snippet and the snippet doesn't have any embedded links. The result now takes up less vertical space as the links for related topics and clinical trials are each listed in a line. The MedlinePlus logo now links to <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/>.

## By Government, for Government

Our search results page now ensures the public has a common search experience anywhere, anytime, and on any device. This meets a key objective of the federal government's [Digital Government Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html).

It has also been tested to ensure it is [accessible to people with disabilities](https://www.section508.gov/).
