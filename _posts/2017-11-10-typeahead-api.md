**_Note_**: this information is for customers who wish to use an API to display type-ahead suggestions on their website. If you are only looking to turn on type-ahead suggestions on your search results page, please review the instructions on our [Display Overview](/manual/display-overview.html) page.

The Type-ahead API exposes the type-ahead suggestions that appear below your search box as searchers enter their search terms.

This API is available for use on official government websites only. You must be a Search.gov customer to access the instructions. [Sign in](https://search.usa.gov/sites) is required. 

Keys and instructions for each can be found under [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites) > YourSite > Activate Search.
