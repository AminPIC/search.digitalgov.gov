<p>Many websites list top or trending search terms (see, for example, <a href="http://www.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/search">Twitter</a>).</p>
<p>Use our Top Searches widget to list top or trending terms, top task terms, or editorial recommendations on your website. It allows you to display up to 5 selected terms on your site, as shown in the sample screenshot below.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.usa.gov/"><img class="img-polaroid" alt="USA.gov search box and trends" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lvlde501Dl1qid15q.png"/></a></p>
<p><strong>How to publish the widget</strong></p>
<p>Copy and paste the widget code where you&#8217;d like it to appear on your site (e.g., your home page, search results page, or all pages). Then, select a label for the widget and update the terms listed by entering terms and URLs.<br/><br/><strong>Why publish trends, picks, or tasks?</strong></p>
<p>Its purpose is part informational, part navigational, and part marketing. Overall, you can use this tool to highlight what is on the minds of your website visitors. It can help visitors navigate to useful content. It also can encourage repeat visits by providing interest on the homepage itself.<br/><br/>First decide how you want to use it and how you are going to label it. It doesn’t have to be Top Searches, but you must determine the focus and intention. Some choices are:<br/><br/><strong>Top trends</strong></p>
<p>You might use this feature to show what the most popular topics are and how they trend over a day, or a week, or longer.</p>
<ul><li>Trends should be a reflection of real search trends or high volume searches within a time period.</li>
<li>Look at your query logs—which are updated in real time in the Affiliate Center—and see how often the top queries change and how often you want to report on these changes. How frequently do you want to update these? Daily, weekly, over weekends and holidays? What are your staff resources?</li>
<li>Look also to see how varied or interesting the top queries are. Do they merit highlighting? Do they increase the interest for your site and encourage repeat visitors, or are they the same queries each day or week?</li>
<li>How good are your results for these searches? Does the search term you list provide navigation to good content on your site?</li>
</ul><p><strong>Editors’ picks</strong><br/><br/>You might use Editors’ Picks to highlight your new content, or most interesting but unknown content, or the best content out of multiple choices.</p>
<ul><li>Picks can be updated irregularly, and can be less labor-intensive than Top Trends.</li>
<li>Do you have enough content, or release enough new content, to show editorially curated choices?</li>
<li>Do you want to educate your users as to the breadth or depth of some content on your website? Or bring attention to under-used but valuable content?</li>
<li>Do you have clusters of information that are time sensitive, such as press releases or reports that you want to bring attention to?</li>
</ul><p><strong>Top tasks</strong><br/><br/>You might use this feature to show what the top tasks are that people come to your site to perform.</p>
<ul><li>These may not change often or may change only seasonally and so while they should be monitored, they may still require less staff time to maintain.</li>
<li>A Top Tasks list becomes a navigational tool designed to get the visitor quickly to the task at hand by providing instant recognition of what the task is called and then quick navigation to the content. </li>
</ul><p>Choose what your one focus is: Top Trends, Editors’ Picks, Top Tasks, or whatever works for your particular agency site. Pick your label, and your intention, and then make sure the terms you select reflect this one, labeled focus. It should be clear what you are providing. Keep your label consistent with the terms you&#8217;re listing.<br/><br/>For each individual term listed in the string of terms, you will have the choice of what to link it to: a specific site or a search results page.</p>

<p>Search the term selected and see what the search results look like.</p>
<ul><li>If the search results page is good, has the best content at the top where the user will recognize it, then you don’t have anything else to do.  Leave the URL box in the Top Searches tool blank.</li>
<li>If the search results are a mix, not completely awful but not going to provide what you want used, then you may have to boost some content to the top of the search results.  The user can then instantly see what to click on. Leave the URL box in the Top Searches tool blank.</li>
<li>If the search results are dismal or very confusing, which a boosted site won’t fix, then in the tool add the URL of the site you want navigated to. The search results page will be bypassed and take the user directly to the site you want used.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, there is a character limit. So you may need to choose the terms you use with this space limitation in mind. You may want to put in only 3 or 4 terms and not fill the available 5 slots.</p>
