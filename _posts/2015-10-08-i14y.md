[i14y Github repo](https://github.com/GSA/i14y) | [Technical Documentation](http://gsa.github.io/slate/)

Do you want to have real-time updates to your search index, and full control over your page titles and descriptions? Then [i14y, our content indexing API](https://github.com/GSA/i14y) is for you! We currently have a [Drupal module](http://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch) and a [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/GSA/sites-digitalgov-search) that will hook your CMS into *i14y*. If you use a different CMS, or don't have one at all, you still can develop an API of your content that meets the i14y specs and send it to us. We plan to develop more CMS hooks in the future, and welcome your partnership if there's a particular hook you need.

## Step 1. Connect one of your sites to i14y

i14y needs to be enabled in the back end for a site to be able to receive content through it. You can 

* [Add a brand new site](/manual/add-site.html), 
* Use the Clone Site tool to copy one of your existing site’s settings to a new site (`YourSite > Dashboard > Clone Site`), or 
* use an existing site.

[Email us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) and let us know which site you want enabled for i14y.

## Step 2. Add a Drawer

After we have enabled i14y for your search site, a new page will appear: [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Content > i14y Drawers.

Click `Add i14y Drawer` in the upper right corner, create a handle, give it an optional description, and click Add to save. [Read more about working with Drawers](/manual/i14y-drawers.html).

If you have more than one website that will be sending content, add a separate Drawer for each of these sites.

We can attach each i14y drawer to multiple search configurations: if you have a drawer that you’d like to use for multiple search sites, [email us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov).

## Step 3. Fill your Drawer

Here’s where the rubber hits the road: use [i14y](https://github.com/GSA/i14y) to add content to your drawer. You can do this in two ways:

* Use i14y directly. [Github repo](https://github.com/GSA/i14y) | [Technical Documentation](http://gsa.github.io/slate/)
* Use a module plugged into your CMS. At this time there is a [Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch) and a [Wordpress plugin](https://github.com/GSA/digitalsearch-wp-i4y-indexer) available.

## Step 4. Review your index

You can view the number of documents indexed for each drawer on the main i14y Drawers list. We also send success and / or failure codes in response to your API call, so if the number of documents in our index doesn’t match what you sent, check those response codes.

## Step 5. Configure your search

Once you have your index populated, you will [set up the rest of your search](/manual/content-overview.html) as you would for a traditional DigitalGov Search site. Set your default search scope on your [Domains](/manual/domains.html) page, add Social Media accounts ([Flickr](/manual/flickr.html), [Instagram](/manual/instagram.html), [Twitter](/manual/twitter.html), and [YouTube](/manual/youtube.html), create [Collections](/manual/collections.html), and set your results page Display (both [search features](/manual/display-overview.html) and [branding](/manual/brand.html)).

If you have any [RSS content](/manual/rss.html) that will not be sent to your i14y drawer, you can add those feeds as well.

## Step 6. Update your search box

Update your website’s search box [form code](/manual/code.html) to point to `affiliate=youri14yenabledsitehandle`.

## Terms of Use

By accessing the i14y API, you agree to [USA.gov's Terms of Service for Developer Resources](https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/terms-of-service.shtml).

***Did you know?*** i14y is hacker shorthand for interoperability, because there are 14 characters between the first and last letters. i14y can also be shorthand for Independence Day.
