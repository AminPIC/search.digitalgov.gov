## Overview

The unemployment rate has hovered around 8 percent since early 2012. So, not surprisingly, many people are hitting the web to search for jobs.

Federal, state, and local government agencies are hiring and have thousands of job openings across the country.

This Jobs API allows you to tap into a list of current jobs openings with the government. Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.

This API is great for job websites or applications, job banks, and career counseling and placement applications.

## Using the API

This Jobs API accepts a GET request.

Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.

Sample API requests follow.

<http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs>

<a name="parameters"></a> 

## Parameters

Five parameters are accepted: (1) query, (2) organization_id, (3) hl [highlighting], (4) size, and (5) from. Only query is required.

### Query

Attempts to extract as much "signal" as possible from the input text. Handles word variants, so a search on "nursing jobs" will find a job titled "nurse practitioner" and "RN." When parts of the query parameter are used to search against the position title, the results are ordered by relevance. When no query parameter is specified, they are ordered by date with the most recent listed first.

Sample query formats follow.

#### All jobs (by date)

* jobs
* positions
* vacancies
* opportunities
* postings

#### Location-based (by date)

* jobs in fulton
* jobs in fulton, md
* jobs in fulton, maryland
* jobs in md
* pentagon jobs
* jobs fayetteville
* fayetteville nc jobs
* jobs atlanta georgia

#### Agency-based (by date)

* job opportunities at the cia
* jobs at the treasury dept
* tsa job openings
* va jobs # will match jobs in Virginia

#### Keyword-based (by relevance)

* nursing jobs
* summer internship position

#### Schedule-based (by date)

* part-time jobs
* full-time positions

#### Combinations (by relevance)

* part-time security guard job openings at the tsa in los angeles, ca

### Organization_id

Specifies which federal agency to use as a filter, based on [USAJobs' agency schema](https://schemas.usajobs.gov/Enumerations/AgencySubElement.xml). Two letter codes are used to span entire departments, while four letter codes are
generally used for independent agencies or agencies within a department.

If you specify an `organization_id` in your API call but the searcher types in another agency, the searchers' agency overrides the `organization_id` parameter. For example, VA jobs are returned when you specify Air Force jobs, but the searcher looks for jobs at the VA (<http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=jobs+at+the+va&amp;organization_id=AF>).

### Hl [highlighting]

No highlighting is included by default. Use 'hl=1' to highlight terms in the position title that match terms in the user's search. Highlighted terms are surrounded with `<em>` tags. 

### Size

Specifies how many results are returned (up to 100 at a time).

### From

Specifies the starting record.

## Data Sources

Data are normalized across government job listings. Federal government jobs are from [USAJobs](http://www.usajobs.gov). State and local government jobs are from a variety of sources.

Are you with a local or state government agency? Or a federal agency that doesn't post jobs on USAJobs? E-mail us at <USASearch@gsa.gov> to let us know where you publish your jobs data. We'll accept your jobs data via FTP or any machine-readable format (such as an RSS feed or API).
