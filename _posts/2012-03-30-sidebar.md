Select which navigation options you'd like to appear in the sidebar on your results page. You may choose at any time to activate an option or deactivate it, or to rearrange the order of the options.

## By Format or Topic

Check the option, Show in Sidebar, to allow searchers to see navigation options in the left-hand column of the results page.

By default, searchers see the options for Everything (i.e., web pages) and Images. To hide Everything or Images, uncheck the option Show in Sidebar. To edit their names, type over the text in the display name fields.

[RSS](/manual/rss.html) feeds and [Collections](/manual/collections.html) that you've provided on their respective pages in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) are listed. By default, these options aren't displayed. To display them, check the option to Show in Sidebar. To edit the name of a feed or collection, click on the hyperlink to update it.

Use the arrows on the left to control the display order.

Determine if you want to include a heading for your navigation options. If you want a heading, type your label in the label field. Keep your label consistent with the options you're listing. If you don't want a heading, leave the label field blank.

***With Heading.*** See the sample results page below that shows the navigation options with a heading, labeled Search, displayed on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov) for a search on *passport.*

***Without Heading.*** See the sample results page below that shows the navigation options without a heading displayed on [WhiteHouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov/) for a search on *jobs.*

## By Time Period

By default, searchers may narrow results by time period for any [RSS](/manual/rss.html) feeds that you've provided on the RSS page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home). If you opt not to show the time period module, *all* facet options (time period and the other Dublin Core facets discussed below) are hidden.

See the sample results page below that shows the time period options displayed on [WhiteHouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov/). Results for *jobs* are narrowed to press articles in the last week.

## By Other Facets

For any of your [RSS](/manual/rss.html) feeds that you've extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) property, searchers may narrow results by the three facets.

Determine if you want to customize the display names for your facets. If you leave the label field blank, we'll display "Contributor," "Publisher," and "Subject" as the default names. Type your desired name in the label field to customize the display name. Keep your label consistent with the options you're listing.
