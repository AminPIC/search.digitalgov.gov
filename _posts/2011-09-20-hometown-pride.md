<p>It has been one of my jobs at <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a>, to check out the local city, county, and state sites which have .com URLs that are to be added to our index: hundreds of them, even thousands. It sounds dreadfully tedious, but actually I have found it interesting.</p>
<p>When I did the first pass on checking .com local sites, four or five years ago, I was struck with who was creating these sites and what the sites looked like. Sometimes it was a good citizen who just wanted to showcase his/her town. More often it was a local high school computer class that took on creating a town site as a class project.</p>
<p>Sometimes the site would be just a static list of officials and phone numbers. Then the amateur webmasters began to create links to separate pages with council meeting minutes on them, or maybe the city hall hours. One problem with these early efforts was that they didn&#8217;t always say where they were! I couldn&#8217;t always tell what state they were in. I had to spend a bit of time getting familiar with telephone area codes to identify locations. We need to know in order to offer a state search to people in our Advanced Search.</p>
<p>My next pass, about two years ago, revealed a more mature expression of pride and community joi de vivre. There was an explosion of available online services like paying a utility bill or clearing up that parking ticket.</p>
<p>But more touchingly, the people of many local city and town sites felt moved to express their pride in a motto at the top of their home pages. Some of this seems motivated by a hope that people will come to settle there and bring their businesses and jobs with them.</p>
<p>But it was, and is, more than just that. They love their communities and want the world to know what they stand for:</p>
