<p>Many years ago I worked for an organization that decided to have its employees work a few overtime hours a week to categorize the internet by subject.  That would be the whole internet, all of it.  We figured we could get this done in maybe six months.  After all, there were nearly a half dozen of us willing to work a couple of nights a week, until summer anyway.</p>
<p>Even 20 years ago this goal was no longer attainable.  The project died from despair in the awful realization that something very big and out of manual control was going on &#8220;out there&#8221;.   The good news is that I finally had the money to paint my house.  I went on to work for a second organization that tried to do something similar, using three times as many people.  It didn’t work there either, although I did get the money to plant some really pretty flowers in my front yard.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a>, we have identified several specific search results problems that still exist:</p>
<ul><li>Content gaps due to poor relevancy or poorly organized organic search engine results.</li>
<li>Content gaps due to high interest news stories or to national emergencies for which content is too recently developed to have been crawled.</li>
<li>Content gaps due to the content not being available to the crawler, because it is too far down in the domain or too poorly described to be found.</li>
</ul><p>One way we editorially intervene is to boost contents to the top of the search results page.  This means we identify high interest queries that initially lead to poor search results, and we place relevant results above the organic web results.  We may boost single URLs or collections.</p>
<p>We sometimes choose one link to head the search results page.  It is a link that goes directly to a website.  There may be more than one link for a query, as shown below for a search on <em>FAA extension</em>.</p>

<p>When we boost single URLs, they appear in a slightly color-delineated box and labeled &#8220;Recommended by USA.gov&#8221;.  They are not expected to stay up long. They may be switched out for new content as a news story or a national emergency develops. Often the content plucked to be boosted soon becomes a stable item high in the search engine results, and there is no longer a need to boost that site.</p>
<p>Collections of boosted URLs consist of a group of topically related sites organized into a display and placed at the top of the search page, as shown below for a search on <em>tornadoes</em>. These collections are put up to address the same problems as single URLs, but may stay up longer.  They may go up and down seasonally, such as for holidays or special events, or may stay up a while to bring together sites that remain in demand.</p>

<p>Once the organic results, or other editorially programmed features, provide a good search experience, then the hand-edited collections will be taken down.</p>
