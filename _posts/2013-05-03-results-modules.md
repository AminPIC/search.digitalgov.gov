### Social Media GovBoxes

[Social media](/manual/social-media.html) channels that you've provided on the Social Media page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) are listed. 

* **Photos GovBox.** When a searcher's query matches the metadata of a photo published any time, the photo appears in the Photos GovBox. 
* **Twitter GovBox.** When a searcher's query matches the text of a tweet published within the last three months, the tweet appears in the Twitter GovBox. 
* **Videos GovBox.** When a searcher's query matches the metadata of a video published within the last year, the video appears in the Videos GovBox. 

### News GovBox Generated from Your RSS Feeds

[RSS](/manual/rss.html) feeds that you've provided on the RSS page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) are listed. To edit a feed's name, click on the hyperlink to update it.

All selected feeds will be grouped and displayed in a News GovBox. When a searcher's query matches the title or description of an RSS article published within the last year, the article appears in the News GovBox. See the sample results page below that shows a News GovBox displayed on the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis for a search on *[gross domestic product](http://search.bea.gov/search?query=gross+domestic+product&affiliate=u.s.bureauofeconomicanalysis)*.
