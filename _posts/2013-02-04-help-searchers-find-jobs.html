<p>One of the most common search tasks is to look for <span>current job openings. </span><span>To help searchers quickly find relevant jobs we&#8217;ve created the Jobs GovBox.</span></p>
<p>When you <a href="/blog/how-to-select-the-modules-that-appear-on-your-results.html">turn on the Jobs GovBox</a>, searchers looking for jobs on your site will see up to three relevant jobs listings on your results page. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Federal Department Websites</strong><span>—If your website is affiliated with a specific federal department (e.g., Department of Commerce), the federal Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across</em> <em>all agencies within your department</em>.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Federal Agency or Office Websites</strong>—If your website is affiliated with a specific federal agency (e.g., NOAA) or office (e.g, National Ocean Service), the federal Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location-and keyword-matched job openings <em>at your agency</em>.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>State and Local Websites and Cross-Agency Portals</strong>—If your website is a state or local government site or a federal cross-agency portal (e.g., USA.gov), the federal Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across</em> <em>all federal agencies</em>.</span></li>
</ul><p>Searchers will also see a direct link to <span></span><a href="http://www.usajobs.gov">USAJobs.gov</a> for <span>all current job openings (specific to your department or agency, if applicable)</span><span>, as shown in the sample below</span><span> for a search on <a href="http://usdasearch.usda.gov/search?affiliate=usda&amp;query=jobs"><em>jobs</em></a> on the USDA.gov.</span></p>
