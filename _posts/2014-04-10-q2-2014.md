Our three overarching goals are to (1) improve searchers' experience on government websites, (2) improve our agency customers' experience in using our service, and (3) ensure we operate efficiently.

As part of our development process, each quarter we set aside two days to step back and review what we did in the last three months, what we'd like to do in the upcoming three months, and how well we're meeting our goals. 

## What We Did Last Quarter (Q2)

* **Agency experience:** Customers see our brand as DigitalGov Search.
* **Agency & searcher experience:** Customers can better manage their best bets.
* **Searcher experience:** Tablet searchers see a nice, responsive SERP.
* **Operational efficiency:** We moved from Solr to Elasticsearch.

## What We Plan to Do Next Quarter (Q3)

* **Agency experience:** Customers see real-time unfiltered analytics.
* **Agency or searcher experience:** Customers or searchers see at least 3 low-hanging, but high impact "visual" features.
* **Searcher experience:** Searchers see a nice, responsive SERP on all devices (phones, tablets, and desktops).
* **Operational efficiency:** Migrate a few high-traffic customers to a "news first" search.
