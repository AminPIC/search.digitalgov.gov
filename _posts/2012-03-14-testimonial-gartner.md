tags: testimonial 
---
<p>Gartner recently published a very positive case study on USASearch (<a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=1909916"><em>Create Better, Faster Enterprise Search With a Customized Open-Source Option</em></a>, January 2012). In the report, Gartner notes that USASearch addresses the key aspects of designing a search system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gartner identifies key stages of action in "Your Enterprise Search Project: The Outward Spiral." USASearch addressed them all:</p>
<ul><li><em>Staffing</em> the project with experts who had domain knowledge.</li>
<li><em>Scoping</em> the project using those personnel to satisfy search requirements for federal websites.</li>
<li><em>Selecting</em> the right technology.</li>
<li><em>Implementing</em> it effectively with workers who have the right skill sets.</li>
<li><em>Measuring</em> results as effectively as possible.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
