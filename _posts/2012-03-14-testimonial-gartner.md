Gartner recently published a very positive case study on USASearch (*[Create Better, Faster Enterprise Search With a Customized Open-Source Option](http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=1909916)*, January 2012). In the report, Gartner notes that USASearch addresses the key aspects of designing a search system.

> Gartner identifies key stages of action in "Your Enterprise Search Project: The Outward Spiral." USASearch addressed them all:
> 
> * *Staffing* the project with experts who had domain knowledge.
> * *Scoping* the project using those personnel to satisfy search requirements for federal websites.
> * *Selecting* the right technology.
> * *Implementing* it effectively with workers who have the right skill sets.
> * *Measuring* results as effectively as possible.
