[DigitalGov Search](/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Analytics > Settings

All of the analytics in the Admin Center are updated in real-time, which means that you  instantaneously see the searches and clicks that are performed on your site.

You see filtered data by default. You can toggle between a filtered or unfiltered view.

* **Filtered.** Several rules are applied to remove bot and other non-human looking traffic. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site's visitors.
* **Unfiltered.** Nearly all searches and clicks are included. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded. Some of you may see dramatically more data in the unfiltered view.

***Did you know?*** The option to view (un)filtered data is a per-user, "sticky" setting. It applies to you only (not any other users on your agency's account). It applies across all of your sites (not just the site you're currently viewing).
