<h2>Highlighted Feature: The federal Jobs GovBox</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that searchers looking for jobs on your site can now see all of your agency&#8217;s current job openings.</p>
<p>Our new federal <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs Govbox</a> displays up to three location- and keyword-matched job openings on your results page. For more information on how to turn on this GovBox, see <a href="/blog/how-to-select-the-modules-that-appear-on-your-results.html">How To Select The Modules That Appear On Your Results Page</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also open sourced all of the code that powers our <a href="https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT/jobs_api">Federal Jobs Server API</a> in Github.</p>
<h2>Fixes</h2>
<p>And, we&#8217;ve already pushed two bug fixes for the federal Jobs GovBox to production. Searchers no longer see yet-to-be-opened or already closed jobs.Â </p>
