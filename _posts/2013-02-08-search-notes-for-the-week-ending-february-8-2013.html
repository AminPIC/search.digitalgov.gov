<h4>Highlighted Feature</h4>
<p>You can now access your raw HTTP logs. These logs contain valuable data on searches, clicks and USASearch tag page loads. </p>
<p>Read <a href="/blog/how-to-access-your-raw-logs.html">How to Access Your Raw Logs</a> for more details about how to request secure FTP access to your logs.</p>
<h4>Other Features</h4>
<ul><li>We open sourced all of the code that powers our <a href="https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT/recalls_api">Recalls Server API</a> in Github.</li>
<li>Searchers are now able to search and see results from collections that are not visible in the left-hand navigation on your &#8220;main&#8221; web results. You can use this option to provide a search box on a small subset of content (such as a policy manual or meeting minutes) while not cluttering up the left-hand navigation on your main results page. (It also helps reduce the likelihood that searchers experience a &#8220;dead end&#8221; on your main results page.)</li>
</ul><h4>Chores</h4>
<ul><li><span>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> 6.3.</span></li>
<li>We optimized the routing of search queries so that they&#8217;re served by the geographically closest datacenter. </li>
</ul>
