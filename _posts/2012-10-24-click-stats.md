The Click Stats page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) reports on the URLs your searchers have clicked on. Data start from October 2012.

You'll see a list, in frequency order, of the most clicked URLs for any time period. You may choose to display 10, 50, 100, 500, or 1,000 results in order of frequency.

See the sample report below that shows the 10 most clicked URLs on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/) in October 2012.
