## Tell Us About Your YouTube Channel

Provide us with the *full URL* for your YouTube channel. 

Some channels use a visitor-friendly name and are in the user folder (such as <https://www.youtube.com/user/NASAtelevision> for NASA). 

Others use an alphanumeric string and are in the channel folder (such as <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCryGec9PdUCLjpJW2mgCuLw> for NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). 

Either URL format works.

## Opt to Display Your Videos

When you add the URL for your YouTube channel, we'll automatically index your videos&mdash;both your uploaded videos and playlists.

We'll show the videos by default. You can toggle the settings for showing your videos on the [Display Overview](/manual/display-overview.html) page, choosing to show them as a facet, inline module, or both.

You can edit the default label, Videos, on the RSS feed on the [RSS](/manual/rss.html) page.

See the sample results page below that shows video results for the [Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for a search on *mussels*](http://search.tpwd.texas.gov/search?affiliate=tpwd&query=mussels).

***Did you know?*** Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery? You can index [MRSS feeds](/manual/rss.html) so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.
