The Page Views page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) reports on the number of times your search results page is viewed by searchers.

For example, if a searcher is on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov) and does a search for *cribs*, the loading of this results page is recorded as a web page view. From this initial results page the searcher can click around to change the filter from web to images, recalls, FAQs, blog posts, etc. Each time the filter changes, a new page is loaded and it is recorded as a page view.

From these data, you can get answers to questions like:

* Which type of search do my users use more: web, image, RSS, or collections?
* Do my searchers use the time-based filters for RSS feeds?
* Which of my document collections is most popular?
* Which of my RSS feeds is most popular?
