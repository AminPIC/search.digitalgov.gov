Do you have a passion for search and helping the public find good, relevant search results? Do you enjoy being part of a small, innovative team? Apply to work with us on DigitalGov Search, GSA's award-winning hosted service that powers the search box on 1,500 government websites.

***Applications are being accepted now through May 23, 2014.*** Apply online at:

* <https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/369615300> (for all US citizens and nationals)
* <https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/369621100> (for current or former federal employees only)

This brief posting period is because of our interest in accelerating the hiring process and shouldn't be interpreted as an indication that someone has already been selected.

About Us: We're a commercial-grade service that gives the public a great search experience on government websites. With about 20 million searches each month, we power the search box on some of the most visited government websites, including NASA.gov, SocialSecurity.gov, USA.gov, USCIS.gov, WhiteHouse.gov, and 12 states' websites. It's so easy to take for granted. You go to a website, enter a term in the search box, and find the results you're looking for. But imagine the cost and time involved if every government agency and website had to acquire and run its own search engine. We take that burden off agencies' hands. By using free or low-cost commercial APIs and open source software, we currently provide the service free to any federal, state, or local agency.
