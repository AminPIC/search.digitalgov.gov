## DigitalGov Search Module Codes

DigitalGov Search calls several different indexes when serving search requests, and we present results from each of these indexes in a separate module. Each module will load when there are relevant search results to display. Each module has a code, and you will see these codes in the Download Details csv files available through Queries or Clicks pages of the the Admin Center analytics section.
