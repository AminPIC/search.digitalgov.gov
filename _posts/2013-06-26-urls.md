Are specific web pages missing from your Bing web results? Tell us about these pages and we'll append the pages to your web results. We offer two ways for you to tell us about the web pages that you want us to fetch and include in our web index. 

1. Add a specific URL manually.
2. Use an RSS feed to manage URLs. 

## Add a Specific URL

Select "Add New URL" to tell us about a specific URL you'd like us to fetch and index. We'll fetch each URL you add manually and we'll index the title, description, *and the full text of the document* for the link you provide. We'll display the title and description you provide (not the page's title or a snippet based on the page's content).

Delete a manually added URL by selecting Delete within the list of Previously Crawled URLs.

## Use an RSS Feed to Manage URLs

You can also use an RSS feed to add URLs. The feed is useful if you'd like to automate the process, add multiple URLs, or both.

Enter the URL of your RSS feed. Click submit. We'll fetch each URL in your feed and index the title, description, *and the full text of the document* for the items you provide. We'll display the title and description you provide (not the page's title or a snippet based on the page's content).

Delete a URL added via RSS feed by deleting it as an item in your RSS feed. We'll remove the URL from our index the next time we fetch your RSS feed. If you need to remove it from our index immediately, you can take the additional step of deleting the URL by selecting Delete within the list of Previously Crawled URLs. 

Note that you must delete the URL from your RSS feed. Otherwise, the URL will reappear the next time we fetch your RSS feed.

You can also delete *all* of the URLs added via the RSS feed by deleting the RSS feed itself.

## Crawl Report of Uncrawled URLs and Previously Crawled URLs

View a full report of all previously crawled URLs by clicking on the View All button to browse the list in your browser, or click on the Export to CSV button to download the list as a comma delimited file.

The source column in the crawl report shows how you added the URL, manually or or via an RSS feed.

***Troubleshooting tip:*** We support RSS 2.0 and Atom feeds. Learn more and validate your feeds at:

* [W3C Feed Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/feed/) (Atom & RSS)
* RSS 2.0 [specification](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) and [validator](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/)
* [Atom syndication format](http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/)

***Troubleshooting tip:*** Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report for your PDF that says, "No content found in document"? Your PDF is likely an image-only, non-searchable file that was created from a paper document using a scanner. See the resources below for more information on how to create searchable PDF files.

***Troubleshooting tip:*** Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report that says your page is taking too long to load? Use [Pingdom Tools Full Page Test](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/) to test the load time of your page, analyze it, and find the bottlenecks.

***Did you know?*** To help the public find your web pages when they search on Bing.com, we notify Bing about any URLs you add. While this helps with search engine optimization (SEO), it is not a cure-all. You still must register for and use commercial search engines' webmaster tools.
