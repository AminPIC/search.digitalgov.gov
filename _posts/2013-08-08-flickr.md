## Tell Us About Your Flickr Photostream

Provide us with the *full URL* for your Flickr photostream. Most photostreams are in the photos folder (e.g., <http://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa> for HUD). Some photostreams are in the groups folder (e.g., <http://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov> for USA.gov).

The URL must be for your overall photostream. You cannot specify individual photos, sets, favorites, or maps.

## Opt to Display Your Flickr Images

When you add the URL for your Flickr photostream, we'll automatically index all of the images in your photostream. 

You can control the display of the images as inline results on the [Results Modules](/manual/results-modules.html) in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home). To show the photos as a GovBox on your main web results page, select the option to show as a GovBox on the Results Modules page.

<!-- END UPDATE -->

See the sample results page below that shows photo results displayed on the National Ocean Service for a search on *[humpback whales](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=humpback+whales&affiliate=oceanservice.noaa.gov)*.

On the image results page, we'll automatically backfill the standard image results from your website with the images from your Flickr photostream.
