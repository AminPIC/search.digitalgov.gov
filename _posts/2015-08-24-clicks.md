The Clicks page reports on the number of times a unique searcher clicked on one of your pages within the search results for a particular query.

Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.

You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site's visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.

Data are available in the Admin Center from August 2014.

## Top Clicks

* The date and time of the click,
* The clicked URL (It is embedded in the request URL. Look for the text following ‘u=’.) and its position on the page, 
* Where the person was when they ran the search and the search term used, 
* The modules loaded in response to the query (Our [Module Codes](/manual/module-codes.html) tip provides a key of the codes and names.), and
