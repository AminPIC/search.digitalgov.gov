<p>Searches for health-related information are very common. So we created the MedlinePlus GovBox to help you provide searchers with high-quality, authoritative health information.</p>
<p>This GovBox offers direct access to <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthtopics.html">MedlinePlus Health Topics</a> and to open studies on <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. To ensure we provide timely information across all health topics, we&#8217;ve done this automatically using the MedlinePlus <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/xml.html">XML files</a>, which cover both the English and Spanish health topics.</p>
<p>If you <a href="/blog/how-to-select-the-modules-that-appear-on-your-results.html">opt to show the MedlinePlus GovBox</a>, searchers looking for health topics on your site can readily find high-quality health information, as shown in the sample below for a search on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=ovarian+cancer"><em>ovarian cancer</em></a> on <a href="http://www.nc.gov">NC.gov</a>.</p>
