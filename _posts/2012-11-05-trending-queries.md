The Trending Queries page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) reports on the top 10 changing search terms.

You'll see a list of up to 10 terms with the greatest gain between yesterday and today. (Terms must have been searched by at least 10 unique searchers per day to be included in this list.)

Use this report to identify newly popular terms. Create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete.

See the sample report below that shows the 10 trending queries on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/) on Monday, November 5, 2012—the day before Election Day.
