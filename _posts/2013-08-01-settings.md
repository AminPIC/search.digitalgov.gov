## Site Name (Required)

Tell us the name of your website. Searchers see your site name on the results page, such as in your page title or best bets. We recommend using the plain language name for your agency or site, such as National Institutes of Health.

## Site Handle (Required)

We use your site handle in the HTTP request to specify displaying your customized settings. We recommend making this handle short and unique, such as nih.

![Site name and handle on NIH.gov's search results page](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/settings.png)

## Site ID (System Generated)

We assign a unique numeric ID to your site. We use this ID for some back-end code. You also see this ID in the URL for your site in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home).

## Site Language (Required)

Choose a language for your site, English or Spanish. We will only index and provide results for pages in your selected language. All display text on the results page will also be in your selected language.
