[USASearch](http://usasearch.howto.gov) > [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) > YourSite > Get Code

Visit our [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home), select your site, and click on the Get Code option in the left-hand menu.

Add the following two snippets of code to your website to "hook" your website and our hosted search service together. You can add this code to your individual web pages or to the template(s) in your content management system.

## 1. Form Snippet

Include the first snippet of code where the form for your search box appears. Your form should look something like this:
    
    <form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get">
        <div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline">
        <input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&#x2713;" /></div>
        <input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" />
        <label for="query">Enter Search Term(s):</label>
        <input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" />
        <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" />
    </form>

## 2. Javascript Snippet

Include the second snippet of code before the closing `<body>` tag. This tag enables type-ahead search and ensures we have complete and timely coverage of your content in our index. Your tag should look something like this:

    <script type="text/javascript">
    //<![CDATA[
          var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };
    
          var script = document.createElement("script");
          script.type = "text/javascript";
          script.src = "http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
          document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
    
    //]]>
    </script>

***Troubleshooting tip:*** If your website is secured with https, you can add 's' to the two URLs above (i.e., <https://search.usa.gov/search> and <https://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js>, respectively) so that searchers don't receive a security message in Internet Explorer.

***Did you know?*** If you're using Drupal, be sure to check out our [USASearch Drupal module](http://drupal.org/project/USASearch).

***Did you know?*** We offer DNS masking, which allows you to show searchers your domain (instead of USA.gov). Follow these three steps to mask your domain.

1. E-mail us at <USASearch@gsa.gov> and ask us to mask your domain.</li>
2. Create a CNAME in your DNS records for *search.yoursite.gov*. Point it to *search.usa.gov.edgekey.net*.
3. When the setup is complete, change the code for your form action from *search.usa.gov* to *search.yoursite.gov*.

***Did you know?*** You can set up one site in your USASearch account that limits results to specific folders or subdomains by either:

(1) [Creating a collection](/manual/collections.html).

Create a collection. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to `action="http://search.usa.gov/search/docs/` and (b) add an input for this collection.

    <input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###">. 

The value is the number for your collection ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your collection in the Admin Center as shown in the sample below.

![Value for the collection ID](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/get-code-collection.png)

(2) [Setting up an RSS feed](/manual/rss.html).

Set up an RSS feed. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to `action="http://search.usa.gov/search/news/` and (b) add an input for this feed.

    <input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###">. 

The value is the number for your RSS ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit or preview your feed in the Admin Center.

(3) Leaving your domain blank on the <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> page and, instead, passing a hidden value for the domain in the search form code.

See, for example, <a href="http://www.ri.gov">RI.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.dmv.ri.gov/">DMV.RI.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.health.ri.gov/">Health.RI.gov</a>. On Health.RI.gov, the following hidden value is added to limit to only the health subdomain.

    <input type="hidden" name="site" value="www.health.ri.gov" >
