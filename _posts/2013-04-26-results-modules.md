Select which modules you'd like to appear on your results page. You may choose at any time to activate a module or deactivate it.

## GovBoxes

Check the option to Show as a GovBox to allow searchers to see inline, contextually relevant results for selected content sources based on keyword matches with relevant queries.

### 1. GovBoxes Built by USASearch

### 2. Social Media GovBoxes

[Social media](/manual/social-media.html) channels that you've provided on the Social Media page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) are listed.

### 3. News GovBox Generated from Your RSS Feeds

[RSS](/manual/rss.html) feeds that you've provided on the RSS page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) are listed. To edit a feed's name, click on the hyperlink to update it.

All selected feeds will be grouped and displayed in a News GovBox. When a searcher's query matches the title or description of a recent RSS article (i.e., an article from the past year), the article appears in the News GovBox. See the sample results page below that shows a News GovBox displayed on [BoulderColorado.gov](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/) for a search on *biking.*
