<p>There is a lot of editorial work behind the scenes in any portal, and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a> is no exception.  Sometimes human eyes are needed in processes where you wouldnâ€™t think it would matter. One area we are always working to improve is our index of state and local sites. &#8220;Just crawl the web,&#8221; you might say.  Well yes, Bing, our web index provider, supplies us with many thousands of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial websites with <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=.gov">.gov</a> and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=.mil">.mil</a> domains, but that doesn&#8217;t cover anywhere near what is out there or what people might be looking for.</p>
<p>For one thing, a lot of local county/city/township sites have .com domains because it used to be, quite a long time ago, that the .gov domain was reserved strictly for federal agencies.  So there are a lot of .com and .org local government sites, and we want to include them in our index.  We want people to know where they can pay their local water bill online as well as where to e-file their federal tax return.   But most .coms are commercial sites, for businesses and entrepreneurs.  They are good places to go for certain kinds of services and products we all use. I personally buy 90% of what I use online, including groceries, but these commercial sites are not from the government. And it is government information and services that <a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a> is dedicated to providing. So we look for government sites that are .coms. We work from lists of local jurisdictions using .com domains we find or that some of our <a href="https://search.usa.gov/affiliates">affiliates</a> submit.  And bless our state portals which are often wonderful, complete sources of up-to-date lists of cities and counties in the state.</p>
<p>In the end, even as we work to process these programmatically, an editor still has to look at many, many of these sites to see if they really are governmental and if the URL is still valid.   What do we look for to conclude we have a useful, valid, government site?  Well, I look for sites that are clearly labeled, e.g. the &#8220;Official Site of Sunken Terrace Heights Township&#8221;, and is a source for:</p>
<ul><li>Transactions that can be performed online such as paying the water bill or a traffic ticket.</li>
<li>Community information such as meeting notices, agendas, and minutes. </li>
<li>City ordinances. </li>
<li>Contacts of officials and emergency numbers. </li>
<li>Services such as when the trash is picked up or where the schools are. </li>
<li>Citizen feedback such as local opinion surveys on this or that regulation being considered. </li>
</ul><p>Not every site will offer all of the above, but good local sites always have some of them. These are the ones we want to be sure to have indexed in our own portal.</p>
