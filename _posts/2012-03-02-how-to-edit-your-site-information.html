<p><strong>Site Name (Required) </strong></p>
<p>Tell us the name of your website. Searchers see your site name on the results page, such as in the page title or in the best bets. We recommend using the plain language name for your agency or site, e.g. Department of Commerce.</p>

<p><strong>Site Handle (Required)</strong></p>
<p>We use your site handle in the HTTP request to specify displaying your customized settings. We recommend making this handle short and unique, e.g. doc or commerce.</p>

<p><strong>Site ID (System Generated)</strong></p>
<p>We assign a unique numeric ID to your site. We use this ID for some back-end code. You also see this ID in the URL for your site in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Site Language (Required)</strong></p>
<p>Choose a language for your site, English or Spanish. We will only index and provide results for pages in your selected language. All display text on the results page will also be in your selected language.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Delete</strong></p>
<ul><li>Use this feature to remove a single URL from the results on your site. Use it for emergency reasons only.</li>
<li>It is not meant to fix the results for entire site, such as for launch or redesign problems. For tips on how to fix these problems, view our <a href="/blog/checklist-for-a-successful-website-redesign.html" rel="bookmark">Checklist for a Successful Website Redesign</a>.</li>
<li>Entire the full path of the URL, e.g. use <a href="http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Benefits.shtml,">http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Benefits.shtml,</a> not usa.gov/citizen/topics.</li>
<li>Note that a list is created, below the entry box, of all deleted URLs. You can undo the &#8220;delete” action in real time at any time.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Troubleshooting Tip:</strong> </em>If you later need to edit your site handle or switch from one language to the other, e-mail us at <a href="mailto:usasearch@gsa.gov">USASearch@gsa.gov</a>.</p>
