In line with the White House's [Digital Government Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html), we're making our code and data more open.

## APIs for DigitalGov Search Customers

These APIs are available for use on official government websites only. You must be a DigitalGov Search customer. [Sign in](https://search.usa.gov/sites) is required. 

**i14y (Beta)**&mdash;This API allows you to send content directly from your content management system (CMS) into DigitalGov Search for real-time indexing. Instructions can be found under [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Content > i14y. Request your site be activated for i14y to enable this section.

**Search Results API**&mdash;This API exposes all relevant results "modules" in a single JSON call, including: web results, best bets, health topics, job openings, recent tweets, recent news, recent videos, *Federal Register* documents, and related searches. Use it to ***pull search results*** from our service to display on your agency's website or mobile applications. Instructions can be found under [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Activate Search.

**Type-ahead API**&mdash;This API exposes the type-ahead suggestions that often appear below your search box as searchers enter their search terms. Instructions can be found under [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Activate Search.

## APIs and Data Feeds for the Public

**[Jobs API](jobs.html)**&mdash;Taps into a list of current jobs openings with federal, state, and local government agencies. Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.

**[Non-.gov URLs API](govt-urls.html)**&mdash;[USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov) searches across all federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government websites. Most government websites end in .gov or .mil, but many do not. Use this API to find all government URLs that don't end in .gov or .mil.

Visit [USA.gov/Developer](http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/developers.shtml) for a full list of USA.gov's APIs and data feeds available to the public.

## Source Code (Public Github Repositories)

**[ASIS (Advanced Social Image Search)](https://github.com/GSA/asis)**&mdash;The source code that runs our image search. ASIS indexes images from Flickr, Instagram, and media RSS to provide a combined search API.

**[i14y](https://github.com/GSA/i14y)**&mdash;The source code that runs our search engine for agencies' published content. i14y indexes agencies' published content in real time, for search through our regular search channels.

**[Jobs](https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api)**&mdash;The source code that runs our jobs search and [Jobs API](jobs.html). Indexes current jobs openings with federal agencies and select state and local government agencies, too.

**[Non-.gov URLs](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls)**&mdash;The source code that runs our non-.gov URLs API. Indexes all government URLs that don't end in .gov or .mil.

**[Punchcard](https://github.com/GSA/punchcard)**&mdash;The repository of synonyms, protected words, stop words, localizations, and other vocabularies that we use to improve the precision, recall, and usability of search results.

**[search.digitalgov.gov](https://github.com/gsa/search.digitalgov.gov)**&mdash;Pages and layout for our website, <http://search.digitalgov.gov>.

**[Site Links](https://github.com/GSA/sitelink_generator)**&mdash;The source code that "decorates" organic web results to provide additional, value-added links to help searchers find what they're looking for. Currently provides one-click links to EDGAR filings for relevant SEC.gov results. Also published as a Ruby gem at <https://rubygems.org/gems/sitelink_generator>.

**[Unique Child Attribute](https://github.com/GSA/activerecord-validate_unique_child_attribute)**&mdash;activerecord-validate_unique_child_attribute is an ActiveRecord extension to enforce uniqueness validations when accepting nested attributes. Works around [Rails issue #4568](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/4568).

## CMS Modules and Plugins

These modules and plugins were developed by DigitalGov Search customers, not us, but we're linking to them here so you have easy access to them. Use their respective platforms to connect with their developers and submit issues.

**[Drupal Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch)**&mdash;Allows you to override the default Drupal search and connect your Drupal website to your DigitalGov Search search configuration. Version 7.x-5.x adds realtime indexing via DigitalGov Search's i14y content indexing API.

**[WordPress Plugin](https://github.com/GSA/sites-digitalgov-search)**&mdash;Allows you to override the default WordPress search and connect your [Sites.USA.gov](http://sites.usa.gov/)-powered website and DigitalGov Search search configuration.
