Searches for health-related information are very common. We created the Health Topics module to help searchers find high-quality, authoritative health information.

This module offers direct access to [MedlinePlus Health Topics](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthtopics.html) and open clinical studies and trials on [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov). To provide timely information across all health topics, we pull the data from the [MedlinePlus XML files](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/xml.html), which cover both the English and Spanish health topics.

If you [opt to show the Health Topics](/manual/display-overview.html) module, searchers looking for health topics on your site can readily find high-quality health information, as shown in the sample below for a search on [*ovarian cancer* on NC.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nc.gov&query=ovarian+cancer&m=true).
