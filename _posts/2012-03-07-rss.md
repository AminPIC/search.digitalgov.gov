Would you like searchers to be able to search your news content and narrow results by date? Tell us the location and name of your RSS feeds. We will index the content on the feeds so that it appears in your results within minutes.

## Example

The U.S. Courts publishes an RSS feed at <www.uscourts.gov/rss/InsideTheJudiciary.rss>.

![Inside the Judiciary RSS Feed](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m0j0q1BUvw1qid15q.png)

The U.S. Courts added this RSS feed to their search configuration by using the RSS option in the left-hand menu of the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home).

![Feed in Admin Center](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m4l7qfv91n1qid15q.png)

*Note:* Click on the preview option to see the content we have indexed for each feed.

On the [U.S. Courts search results page](http://search.uscourts.gov/search/news?affiliate=uscourts.gov&amp;channel=76&amp;query=judge), searchers can refine their results to see only news results and to narrow by date.

***Troubleshooting tip:*** Feeds must include a title, link, description, and publication date for each item. We support RSS 2.0 and Atom feeds. Learn more and validate your feeds at:

* RSS 2.0 [specification](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) and [validator](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/)
* [Atom syndication format](http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/)
* [Feed Validator](http://feedvalidator.org) (Atom & RSS)

***Troubleshooting tip:*** We index the content on your RSS feeds from the time you input them in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home). To backfill historical content, temporarily modify your RSS feeds to return more results. Leave this larger feed in place for one hour. You can do this during off-hours and you don't need to coordinate with us.

***Did you know?*** When you provide us with your YouTube and Twitter handles on the [Social Media](/manual/social-media.html) page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home), we'll automatically index the RSS feed for your YouTube channel and tweets.

***Did you know?*** For any feeds that you've extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) property, searchers may narrow results by these facets in the [sidebar](/manual/sidebar.html) on the results page.
