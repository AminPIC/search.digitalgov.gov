## Set Your Domains

Enter the applicable domains, subdomains, or folders to return results specific to your website. You do not need to include http:// as we recognize domains with or without it. 

### Entire Site

List yoursite.gov (without www) to search your entire site, including all subdomains.

### Part of Site

* List www.yoursite.gov to include only the primary 'www' domain. 
* List subdomain.yoursite.gov to include subdomains. 
* List yoursite.gov/folder to include folders. 

You cannot specify individual URLs. 

### Filter a URL

You can filter a single URL from the results on your site. Use it for emergency reasons only (such as spillage of classified information or unintentional publication of a page). 

It is not meant to fix the results for entire site, such as for launch or redesign problems. For tips on how to fix these more systemic problems, read our [Checklist for a Successful Website Redesign](/blog/redesign.html).

Entire the full path of the URL, e.g. use <http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Benefits.shtml>, not usa.gov/citizen/topics.

You can later use the delete option to remove the filter.

***Troubleshooting Tip:*** You can *exclude* specific subdomains or folders using any of the following options. 

1. List the excluded subdomains or folders in your [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) file. This blocks them from all crawlers that follow the robots exclusion protocol, including Google.com and Bing.com.
2. Exclude them by omission. For example, to exclude subdomain3, list only subdomain1.yoursite.gov, subdomain2.yoursite.gov, and subdomain4.yoursite.gov.
3. E-mail us at <USASearch@gsa.gov> to filter them from your site's search results. Note that this option should be used only if the other options aren't feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.
