To display the results on your search results page, we index content from various sources. Each time a searcher does a query on your site, we determine which index best answers the searcher's question and display results from it. This means a single search results page is often comprised of several indexes.

When you first [add a site](/manual/add-site.html), we pull your homepage into your [domains](/manual/domains.html) list, and populate any social media accounts ([Flickr](/manual/flickr.html), [Instagram](/manual/instagram.html), [Twitter](/manual/twitter.html), and [YouTube](/manual/youtube.html)) and [RSS feeds](/manual/rss.html) that are linked from your homepage. Use the Discover option on this Content Overview page to automatically (re)discover the RSS and social media accounts on your site's homepage, or any other page you want to scan.

You can also add content manually to each of our indexes.

## Add Your Web Pages

When you [fill out your domains](/manual/domains.html), we'll show results for all of your web pages listed within these domains. ***By default, these web results are powered by Bing.***

If you don't like the default web results, you can choose to use another index. Options follow.

**Option 1. Use Our DigitalGov Search Web Index.** We can fetch and index your all of web site's content directly. Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> and we'll work with you to determine the best way for you to tell us about your content.

**Option 2. Buy and Use Google Site Search.** If you already have (or plan to purchase), [Google Site Search](https://www.google.com/work/search/products/gss.html), we'll send a searcher's query to the search index you've provided and we'll render the results within our search results page. 

**Option 3. Use Another Web Index of Your Choice.** Most search indexes (like Google Search Appliance) expose their results as XML. If you have another search index that renders XML, let us know and we'll work with you to determine if you can use it.

Once you've added your web pages, you can create [collections](/manual/collections.html) to give searchers the option to narrow (or, less frequently, broaden) the results to a specific subset of pages.

## Add Your Images

* **Flickr.** When you [fill out your Flickr URL](/manual/flickr.html), we'll index your Flickr photostream.
* **Instagram.** When you [fill out your Instagram account](/manual/instagram.html), we'll index your Instagram photos.
* **Photo Galleries on Your Site.** Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's images? When you [provide us with a media RSS](/manual/rss.html) (MRSS) for your gallery, we'll index its images.
* **Images on Your Web Pages.** We backfill the image results from social media and photo galleries with the images published on the web pages of the [domain you've filled out](/manual/domains.html).

## Add Your Videos

* **YouTube.** When you [fill out your YouTube account](/manual/youtube.html), we'll index your YouTube videos.
* **Video Galleries on Your Site.** Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's videos? When you [provide us with a media RSS](/manual/rss.html) (MRSS) for your gallery, we'll index its videos.

## Add Your News

* **RSS Feeds.** Do you have RSS feeds set up for your press releases, blog posts, or other newsworthy content? When you [provide us with an RSS](/manual/rss.html), we'll index the news items on that feed.
* **Twitter.** Do you use Twitter to communicate about your agency's newsworthy content? When you [fill out your Twitter account](/manual/twitter.html), we'll index your tweets.

## Add Your Recommendations

Create best bets ([text](/manual/best-bets-text.html) or [graphics](/manual/best-bets-graphics.html)) to promote specific web pages. Best bets appear above the standard web results when a searcher's query matches the text of their titles, descriptions, or keywords.

## Turn It All On

After you've added your content, be sure to [set the display options](/manual/display-overview.html) to control how each index appears on your search results page.

We also have three pre-built, government-centric content modules that you can opt to turn on, too.

* **Job Openings.** [Toggle on the Jobs module](/manual/govbox-jobs.html) to show your agency's job openings from USAJobs (federal government) or NeoGov (applicable local and state governments). 
* ***Federal Register* Documents.** [Toggle on the *Federal Register* module](/manual/govbox-federal-register.html) to show your agency's documents posted on FederalRegister.gov. 
* **Health Topics.** [Toggle on the Health Topics module](/manual/govbox-health.html) to show authoritative health information from MedlinePlus and ClinicalTrials.gov.
