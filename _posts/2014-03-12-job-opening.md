**This is a preliminary announcement for a soon-to-be-posted job as a Search Analyst on the DigitalGov Search Team, General Services Administration (GSA).**

Do you have a passion for search and helping the public find good, relevant search results? Do you enjoy being part of a small, innovative team? If so, apply for the position working on DigitalGov Search, GSA's award-winning hosted service that powers the search box on 1,500 government websites.

The job announcement will appear on [USAJOBS.gov](http://www.usajobs.gov) in late March. The position is in the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies at GSA in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. It will be posted as an IT Specialist, GS-2210-11/12.

We're looking for an enthusiastic, talented person to help support DigitalGov Search. The position will support efforts to develop, maintain, and improve DigitalGov Search. It will focus on understanding information access and retrieval, especially search, to guide the information architecture, user interface, and policy decisions that enhance searchers' experience on sites that use DigitalGov Search. It will also focus on designing and implementing processes to ensure that our agency customers have the best possible experience with our service.

The announcement will be posted for 10 business days. This brief posting period is because of the federal government's interest in accelerating the hiring process and shouldn't be interpreted as an indication that someone has already been selected.

About Us: We're a commercial-grade service that gives the public a great search experience on government websites. With about 20 million searches each month, we power the search box on some of the most visited government websites, including NASA.gov, SocialSecurity.gov, USA.gov, USCIS.gov, WhiteHouse.gov, and 12 states' websites. It's so easy to take for granted. You go to a website, enter a term in the search box, and find the results you're looking for. But imagine the cost and time involved if every government agency and website had to acquire and run its own search engine. We take that burden off agencies' hands. By using free or low-cost commercial APIs and open source software, we currently provide the service free to any federal, state, or local agency.

We're sending this pre-announcement so you can spread the word to anyone who might be interested.  As soon as the job announcement opens, we'll forward a link to it so that interested persons can apply.
