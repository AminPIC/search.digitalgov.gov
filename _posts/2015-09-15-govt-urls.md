## Overview

As the U.S. government's official web portal, [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/) and its Spanish counterpart [GobiernoUSA.gov](https://gobierno.usa.gov/) search across all federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government websites. Most government websites end in .gov or .mil, but many end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains.

This API allows you to tap into a list of all government URLs that don't end in .gov or .mil. URLs are searchable by keyword, state, or scope.

<a name="parameters"></a>

## Parameters

Five parameters are accepted.

1. q&mdash;Keyword or phrase for your search query. You also can use this field to specify which states or other preset scopes to use as a filter. For states and possessions, use `usagov` *plus* the U.S. Postal Service's [abbreviations for states or possessions](http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28apb.htm) (such as usagovAK for Alaska and usagovPR for Puerto Rico). The three other preset scopes are usagovFED (non-.gov URLs for federal agencies), usagovQUASI (quasi-governmental agencies or programs), and usagovNSN (Native Sovereign Nations).
1. states&mdash;A comma-separated string specifying which states or possessions to use as a filter. The two-letter code is based on the Postal Service abbreviation.
1. scope_ids&mdash;Use `usagov` to list all known non-.gov URLs.
1. size&mdash;Specifies how many results are returned (up to 100 at a time).
1. offset&mdash;Specifies the starting record.

Combine parameters with `&`.

Fields not already mentioned above that deserve a bit more explanation include:

* **parents**&mdash;indicates the category for each URL, such as federal (usagovFED) or state or possession (usagovAK, usagovPR, etc.).
* **scope_note**&mdash;provides quick information about which government agency owns the URL and how it is used.
* **related_terms**&mdash;indicates an association between two related terms when it seems helpful.
* **equivalent_related_terms**&mdash;indciates two URLs that both resolve to the same website. Neither is preferred.
* **non_preferred_terms**&mdash;indicates a nonpreferred URL. Nonpreferred URLs no longer resolve or redirect to another URL. non_preferred_terms is the reciprocal of preferred_terms and means "don't use" the term following it.
* **preferred_terms**&mdash;indicates the preferred, resolving URL. "Use" the term following it.

## A Tip of the Hat

A tip of the hat to Marilyn Kercher. She started this list many years ago and took it as her personal mission to ensure you can find information from any government website—including those that don't end in .gov or .mil—when you search on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/). She would be thrilled to learn that this list is now open for anyone to access.
