The Monthly Reports page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) reports on the total number of searches and click throughs. A click through is recorded each time a searcher clicks on a results link. Data start from the time your agency started using USASearch (but no further back than 2009).

Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. Change the time period by selecting a different year or month.

View a detailed report of the number of times searchers have input specific terms and phrases by clicking on the CSV link to download the list as a comma delimited file. The CSV file contains three columns.

1. Query&mdash;The search term or phrase.
2. Raw count&mdash;Total number of times the query was submitted.
3. IP-deduped&mdash;Total number of times the query was submitted by any one IP address. This excludes bots and other traffic that send in a query multiple times from one IP address. It is often a more accurate representation of "real," human traffic.
