<p>The Monthly Reports page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) reports on the total number of searches and click throughs. A click through is recorded each time a searcher clicks on a results link. Data start from the time your agency started using USASearch (but no further back than 2009).</p>
<p>Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. Change the time period by selecting a different year or month.</p>
<p>View a detailed report of the number of times searchers have input specific terms and phrases by clicking on the CSV link to download the list as a comma delimited file. The CSV file contains three columns.</p>
<ol><li>Query—The search term or phrase.</li>
<li>Raw count—Total number of times the query was submitted.</li>
<li>IP-deduped—Total number of times the query was submitted by any one IP address. This excludes bots and other traffic that send in a query multiple times from one IP address. It is often a more accurate representation of &#8220;real,&#8221; human traffic.</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> </em>On the first of each month, we email you a report with data on the previous month's queries, clicks, and top search terms.</p>
