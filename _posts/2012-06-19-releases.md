## Features

* We have good news for those of you with lots of PDF files. We've upgraded our PDF parser to [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org/) to improve our ability to index complex, non-standard PDFs.
* Customers may input third party tracking (e.g., Google Analytics, WebTrends, Omniture, etc.) via a request form.
* Customers may upload up to 10,000 URLs via the bulk upload option on the URLs and Sitemaps page.

## Fixes

* Fixed memory bloat associated with log file processing.
