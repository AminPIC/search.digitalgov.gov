Would you like searchers to be able to search your news content and narrow results by date? Tell us the location and name of your RSS feeds. We will index the content on the feeds so that it appears in your results within minutes.

## Step 1. Tell Us About Your RSS Feeds

We love feeds! Tell us about *all* of your RSS feeds, even if you don't opt to show them in step 2 below. Feeds are the fastest and most reliable way for us to learn about your newly published content. 

Select the option to add a new RSS feed. Within this 'bucket' you can list a single RSS feed or many feeds. 

For example, you can opt to list all of your agency's press releases separately (e.g., Police News, Fire News, EMS News, etc.) or you can list all three under one general name (e.g., News).

## Step 2. Opt to Show as a GovBox, in the Sidebar, or Both

Click on the [Results Modules](/manual/results-modules.html) option in the left-hand menu. Check the option, Show as GovBox, to allow searchers to see inline results for the three most recent, relevant RSS results.

Click on the [Sidebar](/manual/sidebar.html) option in the left-hand menu. Check the option, Show in Sidebar, to allow searchers to see a navigation option for your feed(s) in the left-hand column of the results page. To ensure searchers don't encounter too many dead ends, we recommend showing only feeds with a significant amount of content as a sidebar option.

## Step 3. Check Your Search Results Page

**News GovBox.** If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) as a GovBox, searchers will see a News GovBox. This GovBox will highlight the three most recent, relevant results across all of your RSS feeds.

**Sidebar.** If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) in the sidebar, searchers can refine their results to see your RSS-based results only. 

Within the RSS-based results, searchers can opt to limit results to the last hour, day, week, month, or year, or they can set a custom date range. They also can sort results in descending order by relevance (best match first) or date (most recent first).

***Troubleshooting tip:*** Feeds must include a title, link, description, and publication date for each item. We support RSS 2.0 and Atom feeds. Learn more and validate your feeds at:

* RSS 2.0 [specification](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) and [validator](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/)
* [Atom syndication format](http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/)
* [Feed Validator](http://feedvalidator.org) (Atom & RSS)

***Troubleshooting tip:*** We index the content on your RSS feeds from the time you input them in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home). To backfill historical content, temporarily modify your RSS feeds to return more results. Leave this larger feed in place for one hour. You can do this during off-hours and you don't need to coordinate with us.

***Did you know?*** You can click on the 'Preview' option to see the content we have indexed for each of your RSS feeds.

***Did you know?*** When you provide us with your YouTube handle on the [Social Media](/manual/social-media.html) page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home), we'll automatically index the RSS feed for your YouTube channel.

***Did you know?*** For any feeds that you've extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) property, searchers may narrow results by these facets in the [sidebar](/manual/sidebar.html) on the results page.
