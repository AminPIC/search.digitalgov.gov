<p>One of the primary goals of <a href="http://search.usa.gov/program">USASearch</a> is to offer government agencies a free search service through its <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">Affiliate Program</a> so that they can reach their own goal of sharing their agency’s resources and information with the public.<br/><br/>In a recent online discussion, USASearch was praised by the <a href="http://www.doi.gov">Dept. of the Interior</a>’s <a href="http://www.bia.gov">Indian Affairs</a> for offering some critically important services. Indian Affairs (IA), established in 1824, is the oldest bureau of the Dept. of the Interior. The agency provides services to 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives.<br/><br/>About the advantages of using USASearch over other possibilities as their search service, Indian Affairs IT specialist Stanley Smith advised an online questioner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest advantage is the Terms of Service. That, coupled with USASearch’s solid support and neat preview search results ability, are the reasons why we chose to go with USASearch. I would add that USASearch can customize the footer of the search results page as well. Also, they have analytics that are built-in. Analytics have been a really helpful tool that comes with USASearch.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Smith!  We appreciate your allowing us to share your positive opinion that the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">USASearch Affiliate Program</a> is a good choice for government agencies.</p>
