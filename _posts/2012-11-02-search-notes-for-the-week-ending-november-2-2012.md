<p><em>Highlighted Feature: Common Search Metrics for the Digital Strategy</em></p>
<p>Do you ever feel like you&#8217;re drowning in data? Do you feel like finding meaningful insights from the data is like searching for a needle in a haystack? </p>
<p>To standardize and streamline how agencies collect and report this data, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a> requires federal executive branch agencies to implement common performance and customer satisfaction metrics. <a href="http://www.howto.gov">HowTo.gov</a> has published <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/digital-metrics">guidance on common metrics</a>, including describing what you should measure, what to do with the data, and common tools to help you collect and analyze your metrics.</p>
<p>To support you in collecting and reporting your site <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/tagged/analytics">search metrics</a> for the Digital Government Strategy, we&#8217;ve added four new reports to the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>.</p>
