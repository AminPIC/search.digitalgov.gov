<p>&#8220;What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some scholars have alleged that possibly Shakespeare, writing the above for his play Romeo and Juliet, was also slyly poking fun at the latrine-challenged rival theatre, The Rose, across the road from The Globe. There can be multiple intentions behind using a particular word, and the word itself may have several meanings, synonyms, and spelling variations.</p>
<p>In our query logs, for example, we have noticed that the term <em>immigration </em>has been misspelled with at least 20 variations, including: imagration, imegration, imergration,  imgration, imigation, imiigration, immagration, and so forth. </p>
<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a> is the federal government portal for the whole country. We are serving people of different ages, different levels of education, different linguistic backgrounds, and people who may type hastily or just badly. We want people to have a good search experience, if we can help them figure out where they want to go with their queries.</p>
<p>Even if their 4th grade soccer coach was more bedazzling than their 4th grade spelling teacher, we don’t want our users bogged down at the beginning of their search with a spelling mistake if we can help them. Our goal is to get you to relevant results with as few detours as possible.  So, we have added several features to help the public navigate smoothly through a misspelled search query and on to a good search results page.</p>
<p>One feature we employ is a spell checker which detects possibly misspelled words by using a background dictionary to compare search words to.</p>
<p><img alt="Spelling override option for a search on imegration" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lpzfhhhH4b1qid15q.png"/></p>
<p>Notice in the above example that users are still allowed to tweak the contents of the search results and insist on just the results for <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=imegration"><em>imegration</em></a> if they want to.</p>
<p>Spell checkers have evolved over the years from concluding that a word that isn’t in the background dictionary must be a misspelling and then arbitrarily adjusting the search results presented, to allowing the possibility that the search query is actually correctly formed. Having a spell checker blunder in and correct something that isn’t incorrect can cause frustration if users find themselves in a fruitless loop of logical idiocy. For instance, <em>solr</em> is a common misspelling of <em>solar</em>, but it is also the name of an open-source search server.  The public can now override unhelpful spell checker guesses.</p>
<p>Another way of helping the public navigate from misspellings to the form of a word that will go to good results is type-ahead search. This feature suggests topics in a drop down box as the public types in the search box. Type-ahead search suggests popular queries for aspects of a topic, but also gently reroutes the public to the correct spelling of a word.</p>
<p><img alt="Type-ahead suggestion correcting the spelling of mortgage" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lpzfe9O7cl1qid15q.png"/></p>
<p><em>Morgage</em> is a very common misspelling of <em>mortgage</em>. Once the public types in most of the misspelled word, the editorially managed type-ahead search presents the correct spelling of the word, and then the most popular searches for <em>mortgage</em>.  Users can quickly browse the list and select what looks right. This is designed to present the public with the most likely search term which will then provide quick navigation to good search results. Users can also ignore the type-ahead search list, finish typing their own search query, and then click on Search and go to the results.</p>
