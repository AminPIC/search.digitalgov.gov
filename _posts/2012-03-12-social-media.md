Provide us with the URL for your Flickr account. Most Flicker photostreams are in the photos folder (e.g., <http://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa> for HUD). Some are in the groups folder (e.g., <http://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov> for USA.gov).

Provide us with the handles for your Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts. Your "handle" is your agency's pseudonym used within these services (e.g., HUD, HUDnews, and HUDchannel, respectively, for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).

## Tweets

When you add your Twitter handle, we'll automatically index your tweets. You can control the display of the tweets on the [Results Modules](/manual/results-modules.html) in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home). To show the tweets as a GovBox on your results page, select the option to show as a GovBox on the Results Modules page.

See the sample results page below that shows a recent tweet displayed on [SNAP-Ed Connection](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=snap-edconnection&query=pumpkin) for a search on *pumpkin*.

## Videos

When you add your YouTube handle, we'll automatically index the [RSS feeds](/manual/rss.html) for your YouTube channel. We include your uploaded videos and playlists in the index. You can control the display of the video feed in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home).

1. Opt to show the feed as an inline GovBox on your results page by selecting the option to show as a GovBox on the Results Modules page.
2. Opt to show the feed in the left navigation on your results page by selecting the option to show as a filter on the Sidebar page.
3. Edit the default title, Videos, of the feed on the RSS page.

See the sample results page below that shows video results displayed on the [National Institute of Justice](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=criminal+justice&affiliate=nationalinstituteofjustice) for a search on *criminal justice*.
