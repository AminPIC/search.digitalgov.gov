You can use USASearch to power the search box on your federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government website at no cost.

Access to our hosted search service requires authentication and verification that you're a government employee or contractor.

## Sign In

Log in to an existing account or register for a new account at <http://usasearch.howto.gov>. Select the Login option in the upper right-hand corner and fill out your information.

![Login from USASearch.HowTo.gov](http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_meb5z6o0nC1qid15q.png)

After you register, you'll receive an automatic e-mail. Click on the link in the e-mail to verify that your e-mail address belongs to you.

If you have a .gov or .mil address, you'll be able to access your account immediately after you verify your e-mail.

If you don't have a .gov or .mil address, we'll ask for additional information to confirm that you're a government employee or contractor. We'll notify you when your account is approved.

## Add a Site

Select the option to Add a New Site.

Add your basic site information (required) and content sources (optional).

For more information about filling in this information, see our blog posts [How to Edit Your Site Information](/manual/site-information.html) and [How to Edit Your Domains](/manual/domains.html).

Use the options in the left-hand navigation to further customize the search experience for your site's visitors.

***Did you know?*** When you add a new site with a single domain, we'll populate content (such [social media](/manual/social-media.html) handles, <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds, [specific URLs](/manual/urls.html), and [favicons](/manual/look-feel.html)) that we can find from your homepage.

***Troubleshooting tip:*** If you don't see the left-hand navigation, check the settings in your Adblock extension or try another browser.
