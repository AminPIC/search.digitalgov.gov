## Tell Us About Your Instagram Account

Provide us with the *username* for your Instagram Account.

When you're logged into Instagram, you can see your username at <https://instagram.com/accounts/edit/>{% external_link %}.

For example, the Instagram username for the Department of Labor is [usdol](http://instagram.com/usdol){% external_link %}.

## Opt to Display Your Instagram Pictures

When you add the username for your Instagram account, we'll automatically index all of the pictures in your account.

On the image results page, we'll display the pictures from your Instagram account by default. If you'd like to backfill them with the standard image results from your website, [email us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) and we'll turn on your web images for you.

See the sample results page below that shows image results displayed on [DOL.gov for a search on *minimum wage*](http://search.usa.gov/search/images?affiliate=u.s.departmentoflabor&query=minimum+wage).
