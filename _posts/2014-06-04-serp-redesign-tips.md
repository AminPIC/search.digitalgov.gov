As you customize the [newly redesigned results page](/blog/serp-redesign.html) to match your site's [brand](/manual/brand.html), we thought it'd be good to highlight some of our favorite tips.

## Image Assets

A logo that has both the seal and agency name can provide a stronger identity than a seal only or a name only. 

The addition of a name can also give the same seal two very different identities.

* [NOAA Fisheries](http://search.usa.gov/search?&m=&affiliate=nmfs.noaa.gov&query=fisheries)
* [NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nodc.noaa.gov&query=wilmington) 

## Fonts & Colors

[DigitalGov Search](/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Display > Fonts & Colors

Use a background color on the header, page body, or both. For best results, use different colors for the header and body.  

* See contrasting background colors for both the header and body on [Broward County](http://search.broward.org/search?affiliate=co.broward.fl.us&query=everglades).
* See a background color for the body only on the [City of Bloomington, MN](http://search.bloomingtonmn.gov/search?&affiliate=cityofbloomingtonmnsearchresults&query=farmers+market).
* And, for the header only on [DOI.gov](http://search.doi.gov/search?affiliate=doi.gov&query=washington+monument).
* Your background doesn't have to be a strong color. A light gray can provide subtle definition as seen on [NIH.gov](http://search.nih.gov/search?&affiliate=nih&query=library).
* A good, strong color for the search button can go a long way, as seen [Kids.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search?&affiliate=kidsgov&query=washington).
* Especially buttons with a contrasting accent color like on [TreasuryDirect](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=gold&affiliate=treasurydirect).

## Header & Footer

[DigitalGov Search](/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Display > Header & Footer

Use the footer to add navigation and required links.

* [USA.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search?&m=&affiliate=usagov&query=congress) is an example of a federal government website using this option.
* The [City of Minnetonka](http://search.usa.gov/search?&affiliate=thecityofminnnetonkasearchresults&query=lakes) is using the same set-up for a local government site.
* It's also possible to add an email address to the footer or header by using mailto:info@agency.gov within the URL.

## Display Overview

[DigitalGov Search](/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Display Overview

Shorter display names look best for the faceted search and related sites. Try to keep names under 15 characters.

* [USA.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&query=visas) has multiple faceted topics, and a related site for Spanish.

## Content

[DigitalGov Search](/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Content

Tell us about your social media content. Add your Flickr and Instagram accounts so high-quality images appear in your search results.

* [BLM California](http://search.usa.gov/search/images?affiliate=blmca&query=piedras+blancas) and [Louisiana.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search/images?affiliate=www.louisiana.gov&query=hurricanes) display images from its Flickr photostreams.

Don't forget about adding Twitter and YouTube, too.
