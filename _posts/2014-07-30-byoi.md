## About the Pilot

Each year we ask you for feedback about DigitalGov Search and other programs in GSA's [Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729). Many of you respond to our customer experience surveys.

We consistently hear that, in these times of tight budgets, you value our service being free. We also hear you loud and clear when you tell us that you'd like to choose which search results you use&mdash;from Bing, Google, or some other source.

Based on your feedback, we now [index your content directly from RSS feeds or content APIs](/blog/content-integration.html).

We also allow you to bring your own index (BYOI). This helps us make sure we continue to provide you the best, most cost-effective service possible and gives you the choice you want.

## How to Participate

Since this is still a pilot, the setup is manual. Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> to let us know you're interested in participating in the pilot.

We can leverage almost any search index directly. For each web search, we'll send a searcher's query to your chosen search index, and we'll render the results within our search results page.

### Google Search Appliance

If you already have (or plan to purchase), a Google Search Appliance, we can accept the [XML output](https://developers.google.com/search-appliance/documentation/614/xml_reference#results_xml){% external_link %} from your appliance. You'll be responsible for managing the number of documents indexed as this affects the cost of the appliance (such as $x for up to x documents).

See GSAAdvantage for options to [purchase a Google Search Appliance](https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/search.do?q=0:2google+search+appliance).

### Google Site Search

If you already have (or plan to purchase), Google Site Search, we can accept your [API key](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview){% external_link %}. You'll be responsible for managing traffic levels as this affects the cost (such as $x per 1,000 queries).

See GSAAdvantage for options to [purchase Google Site Search](https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/search.do?q=0:2google+site+search).

### Other Search Indexes

Most search indexes expose their results as XML. If you have another search index that renders XML, let us know and we'll work with you to determine if it will work within our system.
