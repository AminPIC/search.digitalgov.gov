## FY18 Announcement

We are pleased to announce two big changes to our service in FY 2018.

We changed our name to Search.gov, and we will use our own indexes to serve search results instead of relying on commercial web search engines.
 
We have a detailed [blog post](/blog/searchgov-blog.html) and a continuously updated [FAQ list](/blog/searchgov-faqs-indexing.html) about this transition. Please read both for a full description of what to expect.
