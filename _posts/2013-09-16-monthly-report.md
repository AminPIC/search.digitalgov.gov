[USASearch](http://usasearch.howto.gov) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites) > YourSite > Monthly Reports

The monthly report gives a bird's-eye view of the number of [queries](/sites/manual/queries.html) and [clicks](/sites/manual/clicks.html) each month. 

Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.

Data start from the time your agency started using USASearch (but no further back than 2009).

## Monthly Usage Stats

Data for the total number of queries and clicks. Use this report to find and analyze the so-called [short head](http://www.searchtools.com/analysis/long-tail.html) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) of your most popular search queries and clicks. 

## Impressions and Clicks by Module

Detailed data for the total number of impressions and clicks and the clickthru rate are presented for each "module" on the search results page. Use this report to inform which [modules you opt to display](/sites/manual/display-overview.html).

## Download Top Queries

View a detailed report of the number of times searchers have input specific terms and phrases by clicking on the CSV link to download the list as a comma delimited file. The CSV file contains three columns: (1) query, (2) raw count, and (3) IP-deduped. 

## Definitions

All data presented on this page (and other pages in the Admin Center) are IP-deduped to exclude bots and other noise in an attempt to accurately represent searchers' intent on your site. Some definitions follow.

**Queries:** Number of times a search query (that is, the word or the string of words) was entered in the search box by a unique searcher. 

**Clicks.** Number of times a searcher clicked on one of your pages within the search results for a particular query.

**Impressions:** Number of times a module is displayed, whether it is clicked on or not. Not all modules are displayed for all queries. Each time a module is displayed it is counted as one impression.

**Clickthru Rate (CTR):** The rate (expressed in a percentage) at which searchers click on a module. This rate is calculated by dividing the total number of clicks by the total number of impressions. CTR is useful to measure the performance of specific campaigns, such as [best bets](/sites/manual/best-bets-text.html) for seasonal events.

**Raw count:** Total number of times the query was submitted. The raw count is provided in the downloadable CSV files only.

**IP-deduped count:** Total number of times the query was submitted by any one IP address. This excludes bots and other traffic that send in a query multiple times from one IP address. It is often a more accurate representation of "real," human traffic.
