<p>The <a href="http://co.des-moines.ia.us">County of Des Moines, Iowa</a>, recently switched to using the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">USASearch Affiliate Program</a>.</p>
<p>About its ease of set up and the advantages of using USASearch over other possibilities as  their search service, Des Moines County IT Department staff shared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was able to set-up the search feature in a few minutes and it is working wonderfully for our site.</p>
<p>I used it to replace the search that was originally set-up by the company that designed our site a few years ago, which was no longer working properly for us, and which we did not want to pay them $100/yr to have an ad-free search. I will eventually customize this, but for now the process of creating it and adding the search feature back on our site was super easy.</p>
<p>Thank you and your company for offering this free service to county governments.</p>

<p>Thank you! We appreciate your allowing us to share your positive opinion that USASearch is a good choice for county governments.<br/><br/><em>The USASearch Team</em><br/><em>USASearch@gsa.gov</em></p>
