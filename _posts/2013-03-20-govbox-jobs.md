One of the most common search tasks is to look for current job openings. To help searchers quickly find relevant jobs we've created the Jobs GovBox. 

When you [turn on the Jobs GovBox](/blog/how-to-select-the-modules-that-appear-on-your-results.html), searchers looking for jobs on your site will see up to three relevant jobs listings on your results page. 

* **Federal Department Websites** If your website is affiliated with a specific federal department (e.g., Department of Commerce), the federal Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings *across all agencies within your department*. 
* **Federal Agency or Office Websites** If your website is affiliated with a specific federal agency (e.g., NOAA) or office (e.g, National Ocean Service), the federal Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location-and keyword-matched job openings *at your agency*. 
* **State and Local Websites and Cross-Agency Portals** If your website is a state or local government site or a federal cross-agency portal (e.g., USA.gov), the federal Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings *across all federal agencies*. 

Searchers will also see a direct link to [USAJobs.gov](http://www.usajobs.gov) for all current job openings (specific to your department or agency, if applicable) , as shown in the sample below for a search on [*jobs*](http://usdasearch.usda.gov/search?affiliate=usda&query=jobs") on the USDA.gov.

 **Did you know?** Are you a local or state government? Or a federal agency that doesn't post your jobs on USAJobs? We want your jobs data. E-mail us at <USASearch@gsa.gov> to let us know where you publish your job openings so that we can include them in the Jobs GovBox.
