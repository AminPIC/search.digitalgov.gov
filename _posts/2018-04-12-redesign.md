We often receive questions when an agency conducts a major website upgrade, changes content management systems, or both. We created this checklist that will help ensure your redesign is successful. 

## Reindexing

1. Keep the file name and directory structure the same, if possible. If it isn't possible, use 301 redirects to send visitors to the appropriate new pages. For more on 301 redirects, read tips from [Bing](http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2011/10/06/managing-redirects-301s-302s-and-canonicals/){% external_link %} and [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633){% external_link %}. Notify other websites that link to you of the changes.
2. Register for the commercial search engines' webmaster tools.
    * [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster){% external_link %}
    * [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en){% external_link %} (now called Google Search Console)
3. Update the [XML sitemap](/blog/sitemaps.html) on your website and notify the search engines via webmaster tools.
4. Notify the search engines of content that has been removed via the webmaster tools. Specifically, in Bing, use the [Site Move tool](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/how-to-use-the-site-move-tool-bb8f5112){% external_link %}.

## Search Setup
5. Within the [Search Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/): 
   * Update the paths for your [Domains](/manual/domains.html) and [Collections](/manual/collections.html), if needed. 
   * Upload a [new logo and update your colors](/manual/brand.html), if needed.
   * Create [Best Bets](/manual/best-bets.html) for any important pages that Bing and Google are slow to re-index.
   * Add a [Search Page Alert](/manual/system-alert.html) to let people know about your redesign and its impact on search.
6. If you are transitioning your website to HTTPS, we have an additional [Preparing Your Site for HTTPS](/manual/https-transition.html) checklist.


If you've undergone a redesign, followed these steps, and your site search results are not what you'd expect, [send us an email](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov).
