Enter the applicable domains, subdomains, or folders to return results specific to your website. You do not need to include http:// as we recognize URLs with or without it. 

## Entire Site

List yoursite.gov (without www) to search your entire site, including all subdomains.

## Part of Site

* List www.yoursite.gov to include only the primary domain. 
* List subdomain.yoursite.gov to include subdomains. 
* List yoursite.gov/folder to include folders. 

You cannot specify URLs. 

## Bulk Upload

Use the Bulk Upload option to upload a CSV file for portals or other websites with multiple domain configurations.

***Troubleshooting Tip:*** You can list folders up to three levels deep (e.g., yoursite.gov/folder1/folder2/folder3). If you want to limit results to folders deeper in your site hierarchy, add our [USASearch Tag](/manual/get-code.html) and then use the [Collections](/manual/collections.html) option in left-hand menu. E-mail us at <USASearch@gsa.gov> for additional information. 

***Troubleshooting Tip:*** You cannot explicitly specify subdomains or folders for exclusion. You can, however, exclude them by omission. For example, to exclude subdomain3, list only subdomain1.yoursite.gov, subdomain2.yoursite.gov, and subdomain4.yoursite.gov.
