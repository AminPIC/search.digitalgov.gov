Do you want to promote a specific web page? Create a Text Best Bet. 

A Best Bet appears above the standard web results when a searcher's query matches the text of its title, description, or keywords.

Text Best Bets have the same look as standard web results. Up to three relevant best bets are listed under a heading, Recommended by YourSite.

See the sample results page below that shows best bets displayed on TSA.gov for a search on *[razors](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=razors&affiliate=tsa.gov)*.
