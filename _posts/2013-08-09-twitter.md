## Tell Us About Your Twitter Account

Provide us with the @handle for your Twitter account(s). Your @handle is your agency's username used within Twitter. When you're logged into Twitter, you can see your username at <https://twitter.com/settings/account>.

For example, the Twitter username for the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service is [@USDAFoodSafety](https://twitter.com/USDAFoodSafety).

## Opt to Display Your Tweets

When you add your Twitter @handle, we'll automatically index *your* tweets. Select the option, Show tweets from my lists, to index the tweets for all members of your lists.

You can control the display of the tweets on the [Results Modules](/manual/results-modules.html) in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home). To show the tweets as a GovBox on your results page, select the option to show as a GovBox on the Results Modules page.

See the sample results page below that shows a recent tweet displayed on SNAP-Ed Connection for a search on *[nutrition](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=snap-edconnection&query=nutrition)*.
