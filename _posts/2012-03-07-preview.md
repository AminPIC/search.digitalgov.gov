As you change your configuration settings, you can preview your search results page before pushing it to your live website.

Visit our [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home), select your site, and click on the Preview option in the left-hand menu. You can also preview your results page by clicking on Admin Center or the name of your site in the breadcrumbs.

**View Current, Live Site.** This option will allow you to view the current, live search results page on your site. This is the only option you'll see if you don't have any staged changes.

**View Staged Changes.** This option will allow you to view the staged search results page before you publish it to your live site. You'll see this option if you have staged changes.

Publish the staged changes by clicking the Make Live/Push Changes button. If you're not happy with the staged changes, cancel the changes by clicking the Cancel Changes button.
