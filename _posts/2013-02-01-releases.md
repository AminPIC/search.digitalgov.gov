<h2>Highlighted Feature</h2>
<p>The display of search results pages is constantly evolving. Some changes are subtle. Others are more noticeable.</p>
<p>In line with industry best practices and commercial search engines, we've moved t<span>he tools for filtering and sorting results to the top of results list (rather than on the left side). </span><span>We've also added an option to clear all filters.</span></p>

<h2>Chores</h2>
<ul><li><span>We upgraded to </span><span><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released/">Rails 3.2.11</a>.</span></li>
</ul><h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul><li><span>Searchers no longer see Did You Mean suggestions for your excluded domains.</span></li>
<li>We fixed a cross browser compatibility issue on the <a href="/manual/query-logs.html">Query Logs</a> page in the Admin Center so that the ‘number of clicks’ column is now visible.</li>
<li>We labeled the Safe Search radio options on our <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?affiliate=govbenefits">advanced search page</a> as a fieldset to improve accessibility for screen readers.</li>
</ul>
