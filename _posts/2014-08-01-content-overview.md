To display the results on your search results page, we index content from various sources. Each time a searcher does a query on your site, we determine which index best answers the searcher’s question and display results from it. This means a single search results page is often comprised of several indexes.

You need to add your content to each of our indexes, if you’d like results from that index to appear.

## Add Your Web Pages

You can add your web pages in one or more of the following three ways.

1. **Give Us Your Structured Content.** We can *fetch* and index your all of web site’s content directly. The most common way for you to [give us your content is through a full-text content API or RSS feed](/blog/content-integration.html). This option provides you with the most accurate and timely results.
1. **Bring Your Own Index.** We can leverage almost any search index directly. When you opt to you [bring your own index](/blog/byoi.html), we'll send a searcher's query to the search index you’ve provided and we'll render the results within our search results page. This option allows you to choose the index that best meets your needs.
1. **Use the Default Commercial Results.** When you [fill out your domains](/manual/domains.html), we’ll show results for all of your web pages listed within these domains. We don’t *crawl* so, by default, these web results are powered by Bing or Google. This option is most useful for portals or other sites that search across many (sub)domains that are outside of your direct publishing control.

Once you've added your web pages, you can create [collections](/manual/collections.html) to give searchers the option to narrow (or, less frequently, broaden) the results to a specific subset of pages.

## Add Your Images

* **Flickr.** When you [fill out your Flickr URL](/manual/flickr.html), we’ll index your Flickr photostream.
* **Instagram.** When you [fill out your Instagram account](/manual/instagram.html), we’ll index your Instagram photos.
* **Photo Galleries on Your Site.** Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's images? When you [provide us with a media RSS](/manual/rss.html) (MRSS) for your gallery, we’ll index its images.
* **Images on Your Web Pages.** If your Flickr, Instagram, and photo galleries are sparse, you can [email us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) to request that we backfill these image results with the images published on the web pages of the [domain you’ve filled out](/manual/domains.html). Note that these images tend to be lower quality than those in your social media accounts or curated galleries, which is why they’re not turned on by default.

## Add Your Videos

* **YouTube.** When you [fill out your YouTube account](/manual/youtube.html), we’ll index your YouTube videos.
* **Video Galleries on Your Site.** Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's videos? When you [provide us with a media RSS](/manual/rss.html) (MRSS) for your gallery, we’ll index its videos.

## Add Your News

* **RSS Feeds.** Do you have RSS feeds set up for your press releases, blog posts, or other newsworthy content? When you [provide us with an RSS](/manual/rss.html), we’ll index the news items on that feed.
* **Twitter.** Do you use Twitter to communicate about your agency’s newsworthy content? When you [fill out your Twitter account](/manual/twitter.html), we’ll index your tweets.

## Add Your Recommendations

Create best bets ([text](/manual/best-bets-text.html) or [graphics](/manual/best-bets-graphics.html)) to promote specific web pages. Best bets appear above the standard web results when a searcher's query matches the text of their titles, descriptions, or keywords.

## Turn It All On

After you've added your content, be sure to [set the display options](/manual/display-overview.html) to control how each index appears on your search results page.

We also have three pre-built, government-centric content modules that you can opt to turn on, too.

* **Job Openings.** [Toggle on the Jobs module](/manual/govbox-jobs.html) to show your agency’s job openings from USAJobs (federal government) or NeoGov (applicable local and state governments). 
* ***Federal Register* Documents.** [Toggle on the *Federal Register* module](/manual/govbox-federal-register.html) to show your agency’s documents posted on FederalRegister.gov. 
* **Health Topics.** [Toggle on the Health Topics module](/manual/govbox-health.html) to show authoritative health information from MedlinePlus and ClinicalTrials.gov.

***Troubleshooting tip:*** We’ve connected your site to your agency on the backend. If you’re not seeing jobs or *Federal Register* documents specific to your agency, [email us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) so we can fix the agency setting for your site.
