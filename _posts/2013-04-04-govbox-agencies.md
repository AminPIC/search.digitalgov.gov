Searches for government agencies are very common. So we created the Agency GovBox to help you provide searchers with easy-to-find, authoritative contact information for federal agencies.

The federal Agency GovBox includes:

* Deep links for direct access to common sections of the agency's website;
* Phone numbers;
* Links to social media accounts; and
* A box to search the agency's website.

If you [opt to show the Agency GovBox](/manual/results-modules.html), searchers looking for federal agencies on your site can readily find high-quality information, as shown in the sample below for a search on [*irs*](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=irs) on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/).
