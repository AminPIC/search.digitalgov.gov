<p>We often receive questions when an affiliate undergoes a major website upgrade, changes content management systems, or both. We created this checklist to share with you four steps to take to ensure your redesign is successful.</p>
<ol><li>Keep the file name and directly structure the same, if possible. If it isn&#8217;t possible, use 301 redirects to send visitors to the appropriate new pages. For more on 301 redirects, read tips from <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/webmaster/archive/2011/10/06/managing-redirects-301s-302s-and-canonicals.aspx">Bing</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=93633">Google</a>. Notify other websites that link to you of the changes.</li>
<li>Register for the commercial search engines&#8217; webmaster tools.<br/>+ <a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmasters/">Bing Webmaster Tools<br/></a>+ <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Webmaster Central</a></li>
<li>Update the <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">sitemap</a> on your website and notify the search engines via the webmaster tools.</li>
<li>Notify the search engines of the content that has been removed via the webmaster tools.</li>
