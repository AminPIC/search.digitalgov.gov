We call several different indexes when serving search results, and we present results from each of these indexes in a separate module. Each module loads when there are relevant search results to display. Each module has a code, and you'll see these codes in the Download Details csv files available through the [Queries](/manual/queries.html) or [Clicks](/manual/clicks.html) pages of the the Admin Center analytics section. 

This page lists all the module codes and their full names.
