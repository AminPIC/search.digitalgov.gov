We often receive questions when an affiliate undergoes a major website upgrade, changes content management systems, or both. We created this checklist to share with you four steps to take to ensure your redesign is successful.

1. Keep the file name and directory structure the same, if possible. If it isn't possible, use 301 redirects to send visitors to the appropriate new pages. For more on 301 redirects, read tips from [Bing](http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2011/10/06/managing-redirects-301s-302s-and-canonicals/){% external_link %} and [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633){% external_link %}. Notify other websites that link to you of the changes.
2. Register for the commercial search engines' webmaster tools.
    * [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster){% external_link %}
    * [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en){% external_link %}
3. Update the [XML sitemap](http://www.sitemaps.org){% external_link %} on your website and notify the search engines via the webmaster tools.
4. Notify the search engines of the content that has been removed via the webmaster tools. Specifically, in Bing, use the [Site Move tool](http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2013/03/15/bing-wmt-launches-site-move-tool/){% external_link %}.
5. Within the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/), update your [Domains](/manual/domains.html) and [RSS feeds](/manual/rss.html) to reflect your new design. If you have set up [Collections](/manual/collections.html), be sure to update the URLs there as well.

If you've undergone a redesign, followed these five steps, and you don't see your content updated in your site search results, please notify us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov>.
