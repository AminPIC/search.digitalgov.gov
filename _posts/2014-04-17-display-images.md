Our search results page uses a [responsive design](http://alistapart.com/topic/responsive-design){% external_link %} to ensure it is optimized for searchers anywhere, anytime, and on any device. 

## Favicon

Provide the URL for your agency's favicon. (A [favicon](http://webdesign.about.com/od/favicon/f/blfaqfavicon1.htm){% external_link %}, short for favorites icon, is the small image associated with your website.)

## Logo

Use the Choose File option to upload the logo, if any, that you'd like to appear in the header of your results page *for searchers on all devices&mdash;mobile phones, tablets, and desktops*. Click on the option, Mark Mobile Logo for Deletion, to delete an uploaded logo.

The optimal size is 100x50 pixels (100 pixels wide and 50 pixels high).

If you don't upload a logo, searchers on mobile phones will simply see the header, *YourSiteName*.
