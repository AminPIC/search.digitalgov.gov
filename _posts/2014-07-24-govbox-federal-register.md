Federal agencies publish notices, proposed rules, and final rules in the [*Federal Register*](https://www.federalregister.gov). To make it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in government decision-making, we created the *Federal Register* GovBox to help searchers find these notices and rules.

This GovBox offers direct access to *Federal Register* documents. We pull the data from the [Federal Register API](https://www.federalregister.gov/learn/developers) to provide timely information across all documents.

If you [opt to show the Federal Register GovBox](/manual/display-overview.html), searchers looking for health topics on your site can readily find the notices and rules that your agency has published in the *Federal Register*, as shown in the sample below for a search on [*autoimmune diseases* on NIH.gov](http://search.nih.gov/search?affiliate=nih&query=autoimmune+diseases).
