<p>The New York State <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/">Department of Environmental Conservation</a> (DEC) was  created on July 1,1970 to combine in a single agency all state programs  designed to protect and enhance the environment. Its mission is to conserve, improve and protect New  York's natural resources and environment and to prevent, abate and  control water, land and air pollution, in order to enhance the health,  safety and welfare of the people of the state and their overall economic  and social well-being.</p>
<p>DEC recently rolled out a new site search functionality using the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">USASearch Affiliate Program</a>. Be sure to visit DEC's <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/">website</a> and take a look for yourself.</p>
