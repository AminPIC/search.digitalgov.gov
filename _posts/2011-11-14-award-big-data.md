<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/program">USASearch</a> is the <a href="http://ctolabs.com/2011/11/gsa-usasearch-wins-2011-government-big-data-solutions-award/">winner</a> of the 2011 Government Big Data Solutions Award, announced at <a href="http://www.hadoopworld.com/">Hadoop World</a> in New York City on November 8, 2011.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ctolabs.com/big-data-award/">Big Data Award</a> was established to highlight innovative solutions and to facilitate the exchange of best practices, lessons learned, and creative ideas for addressing Big Data challenges. The Award judges saw the USASearch Program as a great example of solving Big Data problems to improve government agility and to provide better service for less.</p>
<p>In line with the GSA&#8217;s cost-saving &#8220;build once, use many times&#8221; paradigm, USASearch provides <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">hosted search services</a> for <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and hundreds of other government websites. This is done in a cost-effective way, especially for the agencies involved, which receive these services at no cost.</p>
<p>From the Award presentation: &#8220;The GSA is to be congratulated for their mission-focused, citizen-centered, open approach to a big data challenge and a resulting solution that improves the experience of a broad swath of users of federal services. On behalf of our judges and the many citizens who use this capability on a daily basis we say thank you, and congratulations on this well deserved recognition.&#8221;</p>
