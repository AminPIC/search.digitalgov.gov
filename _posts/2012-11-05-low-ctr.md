The Low Click-Thru Rate (CTR) Queries page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) reports on the top 10 searches with low click-thru rates. It shows the most popular search terms that people generally don't act (click) on.

You'll see a list of up to 10 terms that returned search results, but resulted in a click less than 20 percent of the time over the past day or so. In other words, fewer than one in five people who searched for that topic clicked on a search result. (Terms must have been searched by at least 10 unique searchers per day to be included in this list.)

Use this report to identify issues with coverage. Create a <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bet</a>, add pages that may be missing from the results, or do both to improve recall. Incorporate language from these popular search terms into your titles and descriptions to improve the relevance of results.

Click on any linked word or the <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mceq7b8LbQ1qid15q.png"/> symbol in the list, and you'll be taken to a Query Timeline chart. There you'll be able to select a period of time for the term, and you can also add a second query for comparison.

Click on the <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mceqaa2dn41qid15q.png"/> symbol, and you'll be taken to a list of the top clicked URLs for that term.
