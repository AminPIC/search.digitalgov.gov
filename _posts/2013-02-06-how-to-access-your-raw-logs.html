<p>You can directly access your raw HTTP logs. T<span></span><span>he logs include valuable data on searches, clicks, and USASearch tag page loads. </span></p>
<p><span>With the raw logs, you can conduct in-depth, ad hoc analyses to answer any questions that you can&#8217;t answer using the standard analytics reports in the </span><a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>. You can also automatically integrate your search logs with your other reports and business processes. </p>
<p><span>To access your raw logs, you&#8217;ll first need to u</span><span>pload your public key </span><span></span><span>on the Raw Logs Access page in the </span><a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>. </p>
<p><span>We&#8217;ll set up your public key on our secure FTP servers and send you an email when your logs are available for download. </span></p>
<p><span>Once your key is set up, y</span><span>ou&#8217;ll be able access your log files via secure FTP.</span><span> </span><span>We upload your logs each day, usually within several hours after midnight GMT. After a week, we purge the older files.</span></p>
<p><span>We recommend that you set up a cron script to </span><span>automatically download the latest files each day.</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Troubleshooting tip: </strong></em><span>On Unix systems, you can generate a RSA public key with no passphrase by typing in the following command. G</span><span>enerate the key from the machine or server that you&#8217;ll be using to download the logs. </span><span>Once you&#8217;ve created a key, it&#8217;ll be located at </span><span>/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</span></p>
<p><span>% cd ~<br/></span><span>% ssh-keygen -q -b 4096 -t rsa<br/></span><span>Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):<br/></span><span>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):<br/></span><span>Enter same passphrase again:</span></p>
