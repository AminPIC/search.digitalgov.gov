## Tell Us About Your Accounts

Provide us with the URL for your Flickr account. Most Flicker photostreams are in the photos folder (e.g., <http://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa> for HUD). Some are in the groups folder (e.g., <http://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov> for USA.gov).

Provide us with the handles for your Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts. Your "handle" is your agency's pseudonym used within these services (e.g., HUD, HUDnews, and HUDchannel, respectively, for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).

## Show Photos

When you add your Flickr URL, we'll automatically index your photos. 

You can control the display of the photos as inline results on the [Results Modules](/manual/results-modules.html) in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home). To show the photos as a GovBox on your main web results page, select the option to show as a GovBox on the Results Modules page.

See the sample results page below that shows photo results displayed on the National Ocean Service for a search on *[humpback whales](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=humpback+whales&affiliate=oceanservice.noaa.gov)*.

On the image results page, we'll automatically backfill the standard image results from your website with the photos from your Flickr photostream.

## Show Tweets

When you add your Twitter handle, we'll automatically index *your* tweets. Select the option, Show tweets from my lists, to index the tweets for all members of your lists.

You can control the display of the tweets on the [Results Modules](/manual/results-modules.html) in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home). To show the tweets as a GovBox on your results page, select the option to show as a GovBox on the Results Modules page.

## Show Videos

When you add your YouTube handle, we'll automatically index the [RSS feeds](/manual/rss.html) for your YouTube channel. We include your uploaded videos and playlists in the index. You can control the display of the video feed in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home).

1. Opt to show the feed as an inline GovBox on your main web results page by selecting the option to show as a GovBox on the Results Modules page.
2. Opt to show the feed in the left navigation on your results page by selecting the option to show as a filter on the Sidebar page.
3. Edit the default title, Videos, of the feed on the RSS page.
