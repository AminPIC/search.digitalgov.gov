We offer three ways for you to tell us about the web pages that you want us to fetch and include in our index.

##1. Discovery Tag

The surest way to ensure we have complete and timely coverage of your content in our index is to add our discovery tag to your web pages. Visit our [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home), select your site, and click on the Get Code option in the left-hand menu.

For more details, read our post on [How to Add Our Code to Your Website](http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/how-to-add-our-code-to-your-website.html).

##2. XML Sitemap

Tell us the location of your XML sitemap(s).

A sitemap is a recommended best practice for search engine optimization. For more details on how to create an XML sitemap, visit [Sitemaps.org/protocol.html](http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html).

##3. Specific URLs

Still missing some URLs? Tell us the specific URLs you'd like us to fetch and index. Use the Bulk Upload option to upload a text file with up to 10,000 URLs.

###Crawl Report

View a report of all previously crawled URLs by clicking on the View All button to browse the list in your browser, or click on the Export to CSV button to download the list as a comma delimited file.

> ***Troubleshooting tip:*** Are you having trouble creating a list of your URLs? E-mail us at USASearch@gsa.gov and we can help identify specific URLs on your site.

> ***Troubleshooting tip:*** Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report for your PDF that says, "No content found in document"? Your PDF is likely an image-only, non-searchable file that was created from a paper document using a scanner. See the resources below for more information on how to create searchable PDF files.

> ***Troubleshooting tip:*** Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report that says your page is taking too long to load? Use [Pingdom Tools Full Page Test](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/) to test the load time of your page, analyze it, and find the bottlenecks.

> ***Did you know?*** We follow the [robots exclusion protocol](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) when fetching and indexing your pages. Be sure to allow our user agent (usasearch) to access content you'd like in our index. (Conversely, you can also disallow our agent for any content you'd like to exclude from our index.)

> ***Did you know?*** To help the public find your web pages when they search on Bing.com, we notify Bingâ„¢ about any URLs you add. While this helps with search engine optimization (SEO), it is not a cure-all. You still must register for and use commercial search engines' webmaster tools.
