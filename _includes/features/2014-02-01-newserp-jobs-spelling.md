We've redesigned our mobile search results page. It now uses a card-based design and is responsive. This design gives searchers a more consistent user experience and access to the results anytime, anywhere, and on any device.

Take a sneak peek of the new responsive results page. Go to [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov) (or your website) from any mobile phone or tablet and do a search. Or, add the parameter `&m=true` to the end of the URL on your desktop.

***Spelling suggestions.*** Searchers now see a prompt to correct their spelling on the mobile results page.
