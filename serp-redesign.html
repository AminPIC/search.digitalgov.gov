<p>The last time we did a major redesign of our results page was in January 2012. It was long overdue for a facelift.</p>

<p>So, we've redesigned our search results page. We've kept an eye on best practices in the search industry and media websites (like NPR.org and NYTimes.com) are up to, But, we're not simply following the leaders. We've also <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/07/analyzing-search-data-in-real-time-to-drive-decisions/">analyzed our search data</a> to make data-driven decisions that, ultimately, aim to make searchers' experience better on your site.</p>

<p>Below are some of the highlights.</p>

<h2>Basic Search Results</h2>

<p>We started with the basic search result. Here's the before and after for a search on <em>passport</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/redesign-search-result.png" title="Search result for passport on USA.gov" alt="Search result for passport on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>We've done away with the underlining on the title. The snippet is wider and has more space. Clicking or touching anywhere on the snippet (not just the title) opens the link.</p>

<h2>Video Results</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>careers</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/redesign-video.png" title="Video search result for careers on USA.gov" alt="Video search result for careers on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new video format shows one video plus a clearly labeled "More videos about ..." link. It also shows the video's source (in this case YouTube), the length of the video, and a short snippet. The video is now separated from basic search results by thin grey lines.</p>

<h2>Tweets</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>social security</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/redesign-tweet.png" title="Tweet for social security on USA.gov" alt="Tweet for social security on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new tweet format shows one tweet inline with the results. The old format had tweets in a right-hand column that was often mistaken for an ad. It now shows the agency's Twitter profile image and the tweet is separated from basic search results by thin grey lines and doesn't have a separate heading.</p>

<h2>Search Verticals</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>jobs</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/redesign-verticals.png" title="Search verticals on USA.gov" alt="Search verticals on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new format clusters all options to narrow, broaden, or change the scope of the results together, and places these options directly above the search box. The old format placed verticals in the left-hand column below the box and the option to search on related sites in the right-hand column above the box. It also shows up to three options with ability to show More â€¦.</p>

<h2>By Government, for Government</h2>

<p>Our search results page now ensures the public has a common search experience anywhere, anytime, and on any device. This meets a key objective of the federal government's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a>.</p>

<p>It has also been tested to ensure it is <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">accessible to people with disabilities</a>.</p>
