# Success Stories
USASearch has a proven track record of delivering fast, relevant search results. Over 1,000
government websites currently use USASearch to power their search box and improve their
visitors' search experience.

> We encourage the use of shared services across government agencies and we want to make
> [WhiteHouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov/) an example for others to follow.
> It would not be possible to match the value of GSA's free search service by procuring or
> building a custom solution.
> Previously, we needed to dedicate significant resources to configuring and
> tuning our internal solution, whereas with USASearch, we can now deploy these
> resources to enhance the features of and technology supporting the White House
> website.
