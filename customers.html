    <h1>Success Stories</h1>

    <p>USASearch has a proven track record of delivering fast, relevant search results. Over 1,000
      government websites currently use USASearch to power their search box and improve their
      visitors' search experience.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We encourage the use of shared services across government agencies and we want to make <a
          href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">WhiteHouse.gov</a> an example for others to follow. It
        would not be possible to match the value of GSA&rsquo;s free search service by procuring or
        building a custom solution. Previously, we needed to dedicate significant resources to
        configuring and tuning our internal solution, whereas with USASearch, we can now deploy
        these resources to enhance the features of and technology supporting the White House
        website.<br/><em>&mdash;The White House</em></p>
