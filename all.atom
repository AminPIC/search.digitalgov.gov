<h2>Add a URL</h2>

<p>Are specific web pages missing from your Bing web results? Tell us about these URLs and we'll append them to your web results. We offer two ways for you to tell us about the web pages that you want us to fetch and include in our web index, via an RSS feed (Supplemental Feed) or manually (Supplemental URLs).</p>

<h3>Supplemental Feed</h3>

<p>You can use an RSS feed to add URLs. The feed is useful if you'd like to automate the process, add multiple URLs, or both.</p>

<p>Enter the URL of your RSS feed. Click submit. We'll fetch each URL in your feed and index the title, description, <em>and the full text of the document</em> for the items you provide. We'll display the title and description you provide (not the page's title or a snippet based on the page's content).</p>

<p>Delete a URL added via RSS feed by deleting it as an item in your RSS feed. We'll remove the URL from our index the next time we fetch your RSS feed. If you need to remove it from our index immediately, you can take the additional step of deleting the URL by selecting Delete within the list of URLs on the Supplemental URLs page.</p>

<p>Note that you <em>must</em> delete the URL from your RSS feed. Otherwise, the URL will reappear the next time we fetch your RSS feed.</p>

<p>You can also delete <em>all</em> of the URLs added via the RSS feed by deleting the RSS feed itself.</p>

<h3>Supplemental URLs</h3>

<p>You can also manually add a a specific URL on the Supplemental URLs page. We'll fetch each URL you add manually and we'll index the title, description, <em>and the full text of the document</em> for the link you provide. We'll display the title and description you provide (not the page's title or a snippet based on the page's content).</p>

<p>Delete a manually added URL by selecting Delete within the list of supplemental URLs.</p>

<p>The source column in the crawl report shows how you added the URL, via an RSS feed or manually.</p>

<h2>Filter a URL</h2>

<p>You can filter <em>a single URL</em> from the results on your site. Use it for emergency reasons only (such as spillage of classified information or unintentional publication of a page). Note that this option should be used only if the <a href="/sites/manual/domains.html#filter">other options</a> aren't feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.</p>

<p>It is not meant to fix the results for entire site, such as for launch or redesign problems. For tips on how to fix these more systemic problems, read our <a href="/blog/redesign.html">Checklist for a Successful Website Redesign</a>.</p>

<p>Entire the full path of the URL, e.g. use http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Benefits.shtml, not usa.gov/citizen/topics.</p>

<p>You can later use the delete option to remove the filter.</p>

</ul>


<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report for your PDF that says, "No content found in document"? Your PDF is likely an image-only, non-searchable file that was created from a paper document using a scanner. See the resources below for more information on how to create searchable PDF files.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2007/02/is_that_pdf_sea">Is that PDF Searchable?</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> (blog post)</li>

</ul>


<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report that says your page is taking too long to load? Use <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt">Pingdom Tools Full Page Test</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> to test the load time of your page, analyze it, and find the bottlenecks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> To help the public find your web pages when they search on Bing.com, we notify Bing about any URLs you add. While this helps with search engine optimization (SEO), it is not a cure-all. You should also register for and use commercial search engines' webmaster tools.</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/domains.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > Domains</p>

<h2>Set Your Domains</h2>

<p>Enter the applicable domains, subdomains, or folders to return results specific to your website. You do not need to include http:// as we recognize domains with or without it.</p>

<h3>Entire Site</h3>

<p>List yoursite.gov (without www) to search your entire site, including all subdomains.</p>

<h3>Part of Site</h3>

<ul>
<li>List www.yoursite.gov to include only the primary 'www' domain.</li>
<li>List subdomain.yoursite.gov to include subdomains.</li>
<li>List yoursite.gov/folder to include folders.</li>
</ul>


<p>You cannot specify individual URLs.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> You can <em>exclude</em> specific subdomains or folders using any of the following options.</p>

<ol>
<li>List the excluded subdomains or folders in your <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org">robots.txt</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> file. This blocks them from all crawlers that follow the robots exclusion protocol, including Google.com and Bing.com.</li>
<li>Exclude them by omission. For example, to exclude subdomain3, list only subdomain1.yoursite.gov, subdomain2.yoursite.gov, and subdomain4.yoursite.gov.</li>
<li>E-mail us at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#85;&#83;&#x41;&#x53;&#x65;&#x61;&#114;&#99;&#x68;&#64;&#103;&#x73;&#97;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;">&#x55;&#x53;&#65;&#83;&#101;&#x61;&#x72;&#x63;&#104;&#x40;&#x67;&#x73;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;</a> to filter them from your site's search results. Note that this option should be used only if the other options aren't feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.</li>
</ol>


<p><a id="filter"></a><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> You can remove or filter specific URLs using any of the following options.</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the page from your site and return a 404 (Not Found) 401 (Gone), or 301 (Permanently Moved) HTTP status.</li>
<li>Add a <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/control-crawl-index/docs/robots_meta_tag?csw=1">noindex robots metatag or x-robots tag</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" />. This blocks them from all crawlers that follow the robots exclusion protocol, including Google.com and Bing.com.</li>
<li>Request the page's removal using the <a href="http://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/block-urls-from-bing-264e560a">Block URLs option in Bing Webaster Tools</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> and <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1663419">Remove URLs option in Google Webmaster Tools</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" />.</li>
<li>Use the Filter URLs option under the <a href="/sites/manual/display-advanced.html">Advanced</a> tab.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> Are specific web pages missing from your Bing web results? You can tell us about any missing URLs via an RSS feed or manually (the Supplemental Feed and Supplemental URLs options under the <a href="/sites/manual/display-advanced.html">Advanced</a> tab, respectively). We'll fetch and index the pages and append them to your web results.</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/third-party.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/third-party.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Analytics > 3rd Party Tracking</p>

<p>Do you want your search results page to run web services such as 4Q, AddThis, Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, Siteimprove, or WebTrends?</p>

<p>Input the JavaScript code you'd like to call from your search results page. Click submit to send us your request. We'll input your code for you and send you an email to confirm that we've done it.</p>

<p>Some tips for commonly used third party web services follow.</p>

<h2>Google Analytics Tip</h2>

<p>In your Google Analytics JavaScript, be sure to set your domain if you've requested <a href="/sites/manual/cname.html">domain masking</a> and you want to include your search subdomain (e.g., search.commerce.gov) with your main domain (e.g., commerce.gov).</p>

<pre><code>_gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'commerce.gov']);
</code></pre>

<p>For more information, read Google's tip, <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite">Tracking Multiple Domains</a>.</p>

<p>The code you submit should look something like one of the following two scripts.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics Code (Older Format)</h3>

<pre><code> &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 var _gaq = _gaq || []; 
 _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-########-1']); 
 _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

 (function() { 
 var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; 
 ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl'; : 'http://www') +      '.google-analytics.com/ga.js'; 
 var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s); 
 })();

 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Google Analytics Code (Newer Format)</h3>

<pre><code>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
</code></pre>

<h2>Digital Analytics Program Tip</h2>

<p>Does your federal agency participate in the <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/digital-metrics/digital-analytics-program">Digital Analytics Program</a> (DAP)?</p>

<p>You don't need to upload the full DAP Google Analytics code. You can simply say something like, "Add DAP code."</p>

<h2>ForeSee Tip</h2>

<p>Coordinate with your ForeSee representative and USASearch to implement your customer satisfaction survey on your results page. The four general steps follow.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x55;&#x53;&#65;&#x53;&#101;&#x61;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#x40;&#x67;&#115;&#97;&#x2e;&#x67;&#111;&#118;">&#85;&#x53;&#65;&#83;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#104;&#64;&#x67;&#115;&#x61;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#x76;</a> to <a href="/sites/manual/cname.html">set up a CNAME</a> for search.{yourdomain}.gov.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the files path in your Foresee code to use an absolute path instead of a relative path.</p>

<p> Find => 'files': '/fsrscripts/',</p>

<p> and replace it with => 'files': '//{yourdomain}/fsrscripts/',</p>

<p> in the following five files.</p>

<ul>
<li>foresee-trigger.js</li>
<li>foresee-tracker.js</li>
<li>foresee-alive.js</li>
<li>foresee-qualifier.js</li>
<li>foresee-test.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Ask ForeSee to send USASearch your foresee-trigger.js file.</p></li>
<li><p>USASearch will send you an email to confirm that we've set up your CNAME and installed your foresee-trigger.js file.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It should look something like the following.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.YourAgency.gov/library/foresee/foresee-trigger.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Access Your Raw Logs]]></title>
    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/raw-logs.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/raw-logs.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Analytics > Raw Logs Access</p>

<p>You can directly access your raw HTTP logs. The logs include valuable data on searches, clicks, and USASearch tag page loads.</p>

<p>With the raw logs, you can conduct in-depth, ad hoc analyses to answer any questions that you can't answer using the standard analytics reports in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a>. You can also automatically integrate your search logs with your other reports and business processes.</p>

<p>To access your raw logs, you'll first need to upload your public key on the Raw Logs Access page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<p>We'll set up your public key on our secure FTP servers and send you an email when your logs are available for download.</p>

<p>Once your key is set up, you'll be able access your log files via secure FTP. We upload your logs each day, usually within several hours after midnight GMT. After a week, we purge the older files.</p>

<p>We recommend that you set up a cron script to automatically download the latest files each day.</p>

<h2>How to Generate a Key Pair on Unix</h2>

<p>On Unix systems, you can generate a RSA public key with no passphrase by typing in the following command. Generate the key from the machine or server that you'll be using to download the logs. Once you've created a key, it'll be located at /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</p>

<pre><code>% cd ~
% ssh-keygen -q -b 4096 -t rsa
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
</code></pre>

<h2>How to Generate a Key Pair on Windows</h2>

<p>You can use <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty">PuTTY</a>, a free telnet/SSH client, to generate a public key on Windows. Download PuTTYgen.exe, Pageant.exe, and PSFTP.exe from the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY Download Page</a>.</p>

<p>Run PuTTYgen.exe.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select SSH-2 RSA as the type of key to generate.</li>
<li>Set the number of bits in the generated key to 2048.</li>
<li>Select Generate. Move your mouse within the blank area to create random movements until the key is generated.</li>
<li>Fill out your Key Comment, Key Passphrase, and Confirm Passphrase.</li>
<li>Copy your <em>public</em> key from the string in the Public Key for Pasting into OpenSSH Authorized_keys File. Paste this key into the Raw Logs Access page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a>. (Note: Don't save this public key and send us the string copied from a text file. It adds lines in the file so it doesn't work.)</li>
<li>Save your <em>private</em> key.</li>
</ul>


<p>Run Pageant.exe. Select Add Key and upload your private key, the .ppk file.</p>

<p>Run PSFTP.exe and type in the following. You can find your site's handle on the Site Information page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<pre><code>open YourSiteHandle@198.61.238.46

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/code.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/code.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Activate Search > Code Snippets</p>

<p>Visit our <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a>, select your site, and click on the Activate Search option in the left-hand menu.</p>

<p>Add the following two snippets of code to your website to "hook" your website and our hosted search service together. You can add this code to your individual web pages or to the template(s) in your content management system.</p>

<h2>1. Form Snippet</h2>

<p>Include this snippet of code where the form for your search box appears. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>2. Javascript Snippet</h2>

<p>Include this snippet of code before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. This tag enables type-ahead search in the search box on your web pages and powers the data on trending URLs on the <a href="/sites/manual/site-overview.html">Site Overview</a> page in the Admin Center. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
      var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };

      var script = document.createElement("script");
      script.type = "text/javascript";
      script.src = "http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
      document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);

//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Setting Up a Search Box for Specific Folders or Subdomains</h2>

<p>You can limit results to specific folders or subdomains by creating a collection, setting up an RSS feed, or passing in a hidden value.</p>

<h3>Collection</h3>

<p>Create a <a href="/sites/manual/collections.html">collection</a>. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to <code>action="http://search.usa.gov/search/docs/</code> and (b) add an input for this collection, <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;</code>. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search/docs/" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The value is the number for your collection ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your collection in the Admin Center as shown in the sample below.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/get-code-collection.png" alt="Value for the collection ID" /></p>

<h3>RSS Feed</h3>

<p>Set up an <a href="/sites/manual/rss.html">RSS feed</a>. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to <code>action="http://search.usa.gov/search/news/</code> and (b) add an input for this feed, <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###"&gt;</code>.  It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search/news/" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The value is the number for your RSS ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit or preview your feed in the Admin Center.</p>

<h3>Hidden Value</h3>

<p>Leave your domain blank on the <a href="/sites/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> page and, instead, passing a hidden value for the domain in the search form code.</p>

<p>See, for example, <a href="http://www.ri.gov">RI.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.dmv.ri.gov/">DMV.RI.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.health.ri.gov/">Health.RI.gov</a>. On Health.RI.gov, the following hidden value is added to limit to only the health subdomain.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="site" value="www.health.ri.gov" &gt;
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> If your website is secured with https, you can add 's' to the two URLs above (i.e., <a href="https://search.usa.gov/search">https://search.usa.gov/search</a> and <a href="https://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js">https://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js</a>, respectively) so that searchers don't receive a security message in Internet Explorer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> If you're using Drupal, be sure to check out our <a href="https://drupal.org/project/USASearch">USASearch Drupal module</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> We offer <a href="/sites/manual/cname.html">DNS masking</a>, which allows you to show searchers your domain (instead of USA.gov).</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/api.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/api.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Activate Search > API Instructions</p>

<p>We offer our search results as a hosted results page (using our <a href="/sites/manual/code.html">code snippets</a>) or as an <a href="http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/api-basics">application programming interface</a> (API).</p>

<h2>When to Use the Hosted Results</h2>

<p>Most agencies use our hosted search results page. We recommend that you to use our hosted page for the typical use case of returning search results on your website. Using the hosted page has many benefits such as allowing you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Devote minimal development resources for the initial set up.</li>
<li>Benefit from new features automatically as they're rolled out.</li>
<li>Stay current with search best practices, such as type-ahead search and formatting of search results.</li>
</ul>


<h2>When to Use the API</h2>

<p>You may need to access our search results to present them outside of a typical search results page. We offer our results as an API for these use cases.</p>

<p>You can access the API and its documentation at <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Activate Search > API Instructions.</p>

<p>The API returns results from each of our indexes&mdash;web, image, document (ODIE), RSS (news), video, best bets (boosted content), related searches, and <a href="/developer/jobs.html">jobs</a>&mdash;in JSON, JSON-P, or XML.</p>

<p>We recommend you use our API for limited use cases such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Displaying search results within a native mobile application (i.e., an Android or iPhone app).</li>
<li>Integrating USASearch results within existing applications (such as your intranet or publications catalog).</li>
<li>Creating data mashups.</li>
</ul>


<p>Examples of how agencies are currently using the API follow.</p>

<h3>Use Case 1. Display Results in Your Mobile App</h3>

<p>USA.gov and the White House use the Search API to render USASearch results within their mobile apps.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_me79cgQKOE1qid15q.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a USASearch results page in the USA.gov iPhone app" /><br/>

<p><strong>Related Links for Use Case 1</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://apps.usa.gov/usagov.shtml">USA.gov mobile app</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apps.usa.gov/the-white-house-app.shtml">WhiteHouse mobile app</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/whitehouse">White House Github account</a> (information on and source code for the iOS and Android mobile apps)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Use Case 2. Integrate USASearch Results within existing applications</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.ri.gov">RI.gov</a> manages hundreds of distinct websites. The state provides a consistent search experience across all of its websites. Some sites are centrally controlled by RI.gov. Others are not. Using the Search API, RI.gov programmatically tells USASearch the site's domain from which the user searched (e.g., tmc.dot.ri.gov). RI.gov then highlights results from this specific domain within RI.gov's common look and feel.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows a set of results displayed on Rhode Island's <a href="http://www.tmc.dot.ri.gov">Transportation Management Center</a> for a search on <em>traffic</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_me7ej38m3P1qid15q.png" alt="Step 1. Searcher on &lt;www.tmc.dot.ri.gov&gt; types traffic in the search box" /><br/>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> The Search API is available for government websites only. Visit our <a href="/developer/index.html">APIs page</a> for other, publicly available APIs (i.e., for use by anyone).</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/go-live.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/go-live.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your pre-launch checklist will be unique to your agency's workflow, requirements, and deadlines. A typical punch list to go live with USASearch follows.</p>

<h2>Connect Your Site to USASearch</h2>

<p>Most agencies add these two <a href="/sites/manual/code.html">snippets of code</a> to the template(s) in their content management systems (rather than adding them to individual pages).</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>1. Does your search box point to USASearch?</strong> Update your search box form code point to USASearch so that, when users execute a search, they'll see your USASearch-hosted results page.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;&lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;&lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt; 
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt; 
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt; 
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt; 
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>2. Do you have the USASearch Javascript tag on your webpages?</strong> This Javascript powers the <a href="/sites/manual/display-overview.html">type-ahead search</a>. It also provides data on your trending URLs on the <a href="/sites/manual/site-overview.html">Site Overview</a> page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
     var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };
    var script = document.createElement("script");
    script.type = "text/javascript";
    script.src = "http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
    document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Double Check Your Content Sources</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>3. Have you told us which domain(s) you want to search?</strong> List one or more <a href="/sites/manual/domains.html">domains</a> that you want to search on the first page of web results. Most agencies opt to leave out the 'www' to include all subdomains (for example, list usa.gov to include answers.usa.gov, blog.usa.gov, publications.usa.gov, etc). Some agencies especially department-level portals opt to also include their bureaus' websites (for example, Commerce.gov includes commerce.gov, noaa.gov, trade.gov, etc.)</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>4. Have you told us about your RSS feeds?</strong> We love <a href="/sites/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>. Tell us about all of your feeds, even if you opt not to show them (see #7 below). They're the quickest way for you to tell us about your new and updated content. Feeds also have well-structured titles, URLs, descriptions, and dates that we use to improve your search results page. (Tip: Preview your feeds from the RSS page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> to confirm that we've indexed your content.)</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>5. Have you told us about your social media accounts?</strong> <a href="/sites/manual/flickr.html">Flickr photostreams</a>, <a href="/sites/manual/twitter.html">tweets</a>, and <a href="/sites/manual/youtube.html">YouTube videos</a> are a great way to highlight your recent content. Tell us about all of your social media, even if you opt not to show them (see #7 below).</p>

<h2>Customize the Display of Your Search Results Page</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>6. Have you made the search results page look like your website?</strong> Customize the <a href="/sites/manual/font-color.html">fonts and colors</a> and <a href="/sites/manual/image-assets.html">image assets</a> (logo, background image, and favicon) of your search results page to create a seamless experience for users as they search and browse your website.</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>7. Have you told us what to show on your results page?</strong> Turn on (or off) the modules (that is, the stuff in the center of the page) and sidebar options (that is, the facets in the left-hand column) you want to appear on your search results. You can change the default settings on the <a href="/sites/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page in the Admin Center.</p>

<h2>Set Up Nice-to-Have Features (Optional)</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>8. Have you masked your domain?</strong> We offer <a href="/sites/manual/cname.html">DNS masking</a>, which allows you to show searchers your search.YOURSITE.gov (instead of search.USA.gov). If you leverage DNS masking you will have to change your search box form action from search.usa.gov to search.YOURSITE.gov.</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>9. Have you added the Javascripts for your other third party web services to your results page?</strong> If you have a <a href="/sites/manual/third-party.html">third party service</a> running on your website, you likely want it to run on your results page. Agencies often include their 4Q, AddThis, Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, or WebTrends code, among others.</p>

<h2>Don't Forget SEO (Optional)</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>10. Have you optimized your site so we can find your content?</strong> We follow <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/search/seo">search engine optimization</a> (SEO) best practices. Verify that you have a <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org">robots.txt</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> and an <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org">XML sitemap</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" />. These two files are typically located in the root directory of your website (i.e., agency.gov/robots.txt and agency.gov/sitemap.xml, respectively). Also verify that your robots.txt file allows our user agent (usasearch) to access your public content.</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>11. Have you registered your site with the major commercial search engines?</strong> Register for both <a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster">Bing Webmaster Tools</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home">Google Webmaster Tools</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> to maximize the coverage of your content in their search results.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We offer DNS masking, which allows you to show searchers search.YOURSITE.gov (instead of search.USA.gov). Follow these three steps to mask your domain.</p>

<ol>
<li>E-mail us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x55;&#83;&#65;&#83;&#x65;&#97;&#x72;&#99;&#104;&#x40;&#x67;&#x73;&#x61;&#x2e;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;">&#85;&#x53;&#x41;&#83;&#x65;&#x61;&#x72;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#103;&#115;&#97;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#118;</a> and ask us to mask your domain.</li>
<li>Create a CNAME in your DNS records for <em>search.yoursite.gov</em>. Point it to <em>search.usa.gov.edgekey.net</em>.</li>
<li>When the setup is complete, change the code for your form action from <em>search.usa.gov</em> to <em>search.yoursite.gov</em>.</li>
</ol>


<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> By default, we set up search.YOURSITE.gov (such as search.nih.gov). If this subdomain is already used by another application, you can request YOURSITEsearch.YOURSITE.gov (such as usdasearch.usda.gov) or another pattern.</p>

<h2>Homepage URL</h2>

<p>Tell us the homepage URL of your website. Enter a fully qualified URL, including http://, http://www, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Correct Syntax</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>http://www.whitehouse.gov</li>
<li>http://louisiana.gov</li>
<li>http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/</li>
<li>http://nimh.nih.gov/</li>
<li>http://www.ci.bloomington.mn.us/</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Incorrect Syntax</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>usa.gov (use http://www.usa.gov)</li>
<li>www.nasa.gov (use http://www.nasa.gov)</li>
<li>http://www.ftc.gov/opa/index.shtml (use the higher-level folder, http://www.ftc.gov/opa)</li>
<li>http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000?utm_source=OCM&amp;utm_medium=print-radio&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=shortcuts (use the higher-level domain, http://www.gsa.gov)</li>

</ul>


<p>We use this homepage URL to (a) populate your primary <a href="/sites/manual/domains.html">domain</a> and (b) link the default logo on your results page to your homepage.</p>

<h2>Display Name</h2>

<p>Tell us the name of your website. Searchers see your site name on the results page, such as in your page title or best bets. We recommend using the plain language name for your agency or site, such as National Institutes of Health.</p>

<h2>Site Handle</h2>

<h2>Tell Us About Your YouTube Channel</h2>

<p>Provide us with the username for your YouTube channel(s). When you're on YouTube's website, you can see your username in the URL at http://www.youtube.com/user/YourUserName.</p>

<p>For example, the username for NASA's YouTube channel is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/NASAtelevision">NASAtelevision</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" />.</p>

<h2>Opt to Display Your Videos</h2>

<p>When you add the username for your YouTube channel, we'll automatically index your videos&mdash;both your uploaded videos and playlists.</p>

<p>You can control the display of the videos on the <a href="/sites/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. You can show the videos as a (a) facet by turning on the option to show in the Sidebar, (b) GovBox on your main web results page by turning on the option to show as a GovBox, or both.</p>

<p>Would you like searchers to be able to search your news or multimedia content? Would you like them to be able to narrow results by date?</p>

<p>Tell us the locations and names of your RSS feeds. We index all new and updated content on your feeds within minutes.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Tell Us About Your RSS Feeds</h2>

<p>We love feeds! Tell us about <em>all</em> of your RSS feeds, even if you don't opt to show them in step 2 below. Feeds are the fastest and most reliable way for us to learn about your new and updated content.</p>

<p>Select the option to add a new RSS feed.</p>

<h3>Name</h3>

<p>Create a name for the feed. Within this 'bucket' you can list a single RSS feed or many feeds. For example, you can opt to list all of your agency's press releases separately (such as Police News, Fire News, EMS News, etc.) or you can list all three under one general name (such as News).</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/rss.png" alt="Add an RSS Feed" /></p>

<h3>Feed type</h3>

<p>Select the type of feed. The default option is RSS (for text content like press releases or blogs). Change it to <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss">media RSS</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> for multimedia content like images and videos.</p>

<p>Each item within a RSS feed must include a title, link, description, and publication date.</p>

<p>Each item within a media RSS feed must also include both a <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-content">media:content URL</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> to specify a direct URL to the media object and a <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-thumbnails">media:thumbnail URL</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> to specify a URL to the object's thumbnail.</p>

<p>Any items missing a required element won't display in your search results.</p>

<h3>Sample RSS Item with All Required Elements</h3>

<h2>Step 2. Opt to Show as a GovBox, in the Sidebar, or Both</h2>

<p>Allow searchers to see inline results for the three most recent, relevant RSS results <em>across all of your RSS feeds</em> by turning on the option to show as a GovBox on the <a href="/sites/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. You can also edit the default title, News, on the Display Overview page.</p>

<p>Allow searchers to see narrow results to a specific feed in the left-hand column of the results page by turning on the option to show in the Sidebar on the <a href="/sites/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. To ensure searchers don't encounter too many dead ends, we recommend showing only feeds with a significant amount of content as a sidebar option.</p>

<h2>Step 3. Check Your Search Results Page</h2>

<p><strong>GovBox.</strong> If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) as a GovBox, searchers will see a News GovBox. This GovBox will highlight the three most recent, relevant results across all of your RSS feeds.</p>

<p><strong>Sidebar.</strong> If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) in the sidebar, searchers can narrow their results to see your RSS-based results only.</p>

<p>Within the RSS-based results, searchers can opt to limit results to the last hour, day, week, month, or year, or they can set a custom date range. They also can sort results in descending order by relevance (best match first) or date (most recent first).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Collections</p>

<p>Would you like searchers to be able to narrow results to a specific subset of content within your site or on another site? You can create a collection across any set of domains, subdomains, or subfolders.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Create a Collection</h2>

<p>Enter a name for the collection (e.g., FAQs).</p>

<p>Enter the URLs that make up this collection. Start each URL prefix with http:// and end it in a trailing slash () to avoid unintended matches (e.g., http://publications.agency.gov/docs/ and http://answers.agency.gov).</p>

<!-- START UPDATE -->


<h2>Step 2. Opt to Show in Sidebar</h2>

<p>Click on the <a href="/sites/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. Check the option, Show in Sidebar, to allow searchers to see navigation options in the left-hand column of the results page.</p>

<!-- END UPDATE -->


<h2>Step 3. Check Your Search Results Page</h2>

<p>Searchers will see an option to narrow their search results to pages in this collection in the left-hand navigation on the results page.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/manual-collection-2.png" alt="Collection on the search results page" /></p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can click on the 'Preview' option to see the content we have indexed for each of your collections.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can set up a search box on your website that limits results to your collection.</p>

<p>Start with the standard form snippet on the <a href="/sites/manual/activate.html">Activate Search</a> page. Change the form action to <code>action="http://search.usa.gov/search/docs</code> and add the following line to limit the results to your collection.</p>

<p><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;</code></p>

<p>The value is the number for your collection ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your collection in the Admin Center.</p>

<p>See the sample search box below that is limited to news releases in <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/index.shtml">FTC.gov's Newroom</a> for a search on <em>privacy</em>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Dashboard > Site Overview</p>

<p>The Site Overview page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> provides a snapshot of what has been happening on your site in the past day or so.</p>

<h2>Top Queries</h2>

<p>Reports on the top 10 searches done by searchers on your site. If you don't have any searches, you'll see a message that there aren't enough query data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.</p>

<p>Note that the data are processed to present "real" searches by humans (that is, the data are de-duped by IP address to remove bot traffic and other noise).</p>

<h2>Top Clicked URLs</h2>

<p>Reports on the top 10 pages that were clicked thru by searchers on your search results page. If you don't have any clicks, you'll see a message that there aren't enough click data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.</p>

<h2>Trending URLs</h2>

<p>If there are any pages that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing URLs that were <em>visited by users on your website</em>.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular pages on your website. Investigate why pages are trending, if the reason is not immediately apparent.</p>

<p>Note that you'll only see this list of trending URLs if you have our <a href="/sites/manual/code.html">Javascript snippet</a> on your web pages. Data are updated every few minutes so this is near real-time information and you may see URLs come and go quickly.</p>

<h2>Trending Queries</h2>

<p>If there are any queries that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing search terms with the greatest <em>gain</em> between yesterday and today.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular terms. Create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete.</p>

<h2>Queries with No Results</h2>

<p>If there are any terms that returned no results, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 queries with no results.</p>

<p>For example, on one agency's website in October 2012, a dozen searches for <em>frostline</em> returned no results. The frost line&mdash;also known as depth of frost or freezing&mdash;is the depth to which the groundwater in soil is expected to freeze. The agency's pages on the topic referred to this concept as <em>depth of freezing</em>.</p>

<p>Use this alert about results data to help searchers find your content by adding a <a href="/sites/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bet</a>, updating your existing web pages, or both.</p>

<h2>Top Queries with Low Click Thrus</h2>

<p>If there are any frequently searched terms that returned results but didn't result in a click at least 20% of the time, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 searches with low click thru rates.</p>

<p>Use this alert about low click thrus to identify issues with coverage. You may opt to create a <a href="/sites/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bet</a>, add pages that may be missing from the results, or do both to improve recall. Or, you may opt to incorporate language from these popular search terms into your titles and descriptions to improve the relevance of results.</p>

<h2>This Month's Totals to Date</h2>

<p>Reports on the total number of queries and clicks for the present month-to-date. A click  is recorded each time a searcher clicks on a results link.</p>

<p>A graph of your site's total search queries over time is also presented to provide an overview of how your traffic has trended from the time your agency started using USASearch (but no further back than 2010). Hover over the trend line to see the total number of queries in previous months.</p>

<h2>Tell Us About Your Flickr Photostream</h2>

<p>Provide us with the <em>full URL</em> for your Flickr photostream. Most photostreams are in the photos folder (e.g., <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa">http://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> for HUD). Some photostreams are in the groups folder (e.g., <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov">http://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> for USA.gov).</p>

<p>The URL must be for your overall photostream. You cannot specify individual photos, sets, favorites, or maps.</p>

<!-- START UPDATE -->


<h2>Opt to Display Your Flickr Images</h2>

<p>When you add the URL for your Flickr photostream, we'll automatically index all of the images in your photostream.</p>

<p>On the image results page, we'll automatically backfill the standard image results from your website with the images from your Flickr photostream.</p>

<p>You can also opt to display images GovBox on your main web results page by turning on the option to show as a GovBox on the <a href="/sites/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page.</p>

<!-- END UPDATE -->


<p>See the sample results page below that shows photo results displayed on the National Ocean Service for a search on <em><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=humpback+whales&amp;affiliate=oceanservice.noaa.gov">humpback whales</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Display Name (Required)</h2>

<p>Tell us the name of your website. Searchers see your site name on the results page, such as in your page title or best bets. We recommend using the plain language name for your agency or site, such as National Institutes of Health.</p>

<h2>Site Handle (Required)</h2>

<p>We use your site handle in the HTTP request to specify displaying your customized settings. We recommend making this handle short and unique, such as nih.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/settings.png" alt="Site name and handle on NIH.gov's search results page" /></p>

<h2>Site ID (System Generated)</h2>

<p>We assign a unique numeric ID to your site. We use this ID for some back-end code. You also see this ID in the URL for your site in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<h2>Site Language (Required)</h2>

<p>Choose a language for your site, English or Spanish. We will only index and provide results for pages in your selected language. All display text on the results page will also be in your selected language.</p>

<h2>Delete</h2>

<p>After you've set up a site, you may want to delete it. <strong>Use caution.</strong> This action permanently deletes your site and its associated analytics and indexes. We cannot restore deleted sites.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> If you later need to edit your site handle or language, e-mail us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#85;&#x53;&#x41;&#x53;&#101;&#x61;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#x67;&#115;&#97;&#46;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;">&#85;&#83;&#x41;&#83;&#101;&#97;&#x72;&#99;&#x68;&#64;&#x67;&#x73;&#97;&#46;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When you're buying and using products, safety comes first.</p>

<p>Six federal regulatory agencies issue recalls on <a href="http://www.recalls.gov">Recalls.gov</a>.</p>

<p>This Recalls API allows you to tap into a list of (1) drug and food safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.fda.gov">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA), <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov">U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service</a> (UDSA FSIS), and <a href="http://www.FoodSafety.gov">FoodSafety.gov</a>; (2) car safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA); and (3) product safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> (CPSC).</p>

<p>This API is great for consumer safety websites or applications, news organizations, and websites or magazines targeted to specific audiences, such as parents.</p>

<p><a name="using-the-api"></a></p>

<h2>Using the API</h2>

<p>This Recalls API accepts a GET request.</p>

<p>Recalls are searchable by keyword, issuing agency, date, UPC code, vehicle-specific attributes, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>The base URL is http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?<strong>parameters</strong></p>

<p>Sample API requests follow.</p>

<p>All recalls<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?</a></p>

<p>All cribs<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs</a></p>

<p>All cribs that pose a choking hazard<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking</a></p>

<p>All cribs that pose a choking hazard sorted by date<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking&amp;sort=date">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking&amp;sort=date</a></p>

<p><a name="parameters"></a></p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>Seven generic parameters are accepted.</p>

<ol>
<li>query</li>
<li>organization</li>
<li>start_date</li>
<li>end_date</li>
<li>page</li>
<li>per_page</li>
<li>sort</li>
</ol>


<p>There are additional parameters that are specific to food, product, and car safety recalls. None are required.</p>

<h3>query</h3>

<p>Attempts to extract as much "signal" as possible from the input text. Handles word variants, so a search on "choke" will find a recall categorized as a "choking" hazard.</p>

<h3>organization</h3>

<p>Specifies which agency issued the recall. Possible values are <code>CPSC</code>, <code>FDA</code>, <code>NHTSA</code>, or <code>USDA</code>.</p>

<p>Example (one agency): <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?organization=nhtsa">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?organization=nhtsa</a></p>

<p>Example (multiple agencies): <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?organization=fda+usda">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?organization=fda+usda</a></p>

<h3>start_date</h3>

<p>Specifies the start date of the recall.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?start_date=2012-01-01">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?start_date=2012-01-01</a></p>

<h3>end_date</h3>

<p>Specifies the end date of the recall.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?end_date=2012-12-31">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?end_date=2012-12-31</a></p>

<h3>page</h3>

<p>Specifies the pagination of search results. Possible values are <code>1</code> to <code>20</code>.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?page=3">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?page=3</a></p>

<h3>per_page</h3>

<p>Specifies the number of search results for each page. Possible values are <code>1</code> to <code>50</code>.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?per_page=10">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?per_page=10</a></p>

<h3>sort</h3>

<p>Results are sorted by relevance by default. Possible values are <code>rel</code> or <code>date</code>. Use 'sort=date' to sort results by date with the most recent listed first.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?sort=date">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?sort=date</a></p>

<h3>food_type</h3>

<p>Only for drug and food safety recalls. Possible values are <code>food</code> or <code>drug</code>.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?food_type=drug">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?food_type=drug</a></p>

<h3>upc</h3>

<p>Only for CPSC recalls. Specifies the UPC code when available. Not all products have UPC codes.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?upc=042666601627">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?upc=042666601627</a></p>

<h3>make, model, year, and code (only for NHTSA recalls)</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>make</code> specifies the make of the vehicle or equipment. Example: <a href="http://localhost:3000/search?make=winnebago">http://localhost:3000/search?make=winnebago</a></li>
<li><code>model</code> specifies the model of the vehicle or equipment. Example: <a href="http://localhost:3000/search?model=ellipse">http://localhost:3000/search?model=ellipse</a></li>

</ul>


<p><a name="data-sources"></a></p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<p>We've tailored this Recalls API for our use in the <a href="http://apps.usa.gov/usagov.shtml">USA.gov iPhone app</a> and <a href="http://apps.usa.gov/product-recalls-2.shtml">Product Recalls Android app</a>.</p>

<p>Data are normalized across (1) drug and food safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.fda.gov">FDA</a>, <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov">UDSA FSIS</a>, and <a href="http://www.FoodSafety.gov">FoodSafety.gov</a>; (2) car safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov">NHTSA</a>; and (3) product safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov">CPSC</a>.</p>

<p>So, we encourage you to use the five original data sources directly or via <a href="http://www.recalls.gov">Recalls.gov</a>.</p>

<p><a name="overview"></a></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The unemployment rate has hovered around 8 percent since early 2012. So, not surprisingly, many people are hitting the web to search for jobs.</p>

<p>Federal, state, and local government agencies are hiring and have thousands of job openings across the country.</p>

<p>This Jobs API allows you to tap into a list of current jobs openings with the government. Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>This API is great for job websites or applications, job banks, and career counseling and placement applications.</p>

<p><a name="using-the-api"></a></p>

<h2>Using the API</h2>

<p>This Jobs API accepts a GET request.</p>

<p>Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>The base URL is http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?<strong>parameters</strong></p>

<p>Sample API requests follow.</p>

<p>All nursing jobs<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs</a></p>

<p>Nursing jobs in NY<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs+in+ny">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs+in+ny</a></p>

<p>Nursing jobs with a state government agency<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs&amp;tags=state">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs&amp;tags=state</a></p>

<p>Nursing jobs with a federal government agency<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs&amp;tags=federal">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs&amp;tags=federal</a></p>

<p>Nursing jobs with Veterans Affairs in NY<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs+with+veterans+affairs+in+ny">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs+with+veterans+affairs+in+ny</a></p>

<p>Part-time nursing jobs with Veterans Affairs in NY<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=parttime+nursing+jobs+with+veterans+affairs+in+ny">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=parttime+nursing+jobs+with+veterans+affairs+in+ny</a></p>

<p><a name="parameters"></a></p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>Seven parameters are accepted.</p>

<ol>
<li>query</li>
<li>organization_id</li>
<li>hl (for highlighting)</li>
<li>size</li>
<li>from</li>
<li>tags</li>
<li>lat_lon</li>
</ol>


<h3>Query</h3>

<p>Attempts to extract as much "signal" as possible from the input text. Handles word variants, so a search on "nursing jobs" will find a job titled "nurse practitioner" and "RN." When parts of the query parameter are used to search against the position title, the results are ordered by relevance. When no query parameter is specified, they are ordered by date with the most recent listed first.  For generic jobs searches (e.g., 'jobs', 'internships') where the <strong>lat_lon</strong> parameter is passed in, the results will be sorted by distance to the searcher's geographic location.</p>

<p>Sample query formats follow.</p>

<h4>All jobs (by date or by proximity)</h4>

<ul>
<li>jobs</li>
<li>positions</li>
<li>vacancies</li>
<li>opportunities</li>
<li>postings</li>
</ul>


<h4>Location-based (by date)</h4>

<ul>
<li>jobs in fulton</li>
<li>jobs in fulton, md</li>
<li>jobs in fulton, maryland</li>
<li>jobs in md</li>
<li>pentagon jobs</li>
<li>jobs fayetteville</li>
<li>fayetteville nc jobs</li>
<li>jobs atlanta georgia</li>
</ul>


<h4>Agency-based (by date)</h4>

<ul>
<li>job opportunities at the cia</li>
<li>jobs at the treasury dept</li>
<li>tsa job openings</li>
<li>va jobs # will match jobs in Virginia</li>
</ul>


<h4>Keyword-based (by relevance)</h4>

<ul>
<li>nursing jobs</li>
<li>summer internship position</li>
</ul>


<h4>Schedule-based (by date)</h4>

<ul>
<li>part-time jobs</li>
<li>full-time positions</li>
</ul>


<h4>Combinations (by relevance)</h4>

<ul>
<li>part-time security guard job openings at the tsa in los angeles, ca</li>
</ul>


<h3>Organization_id</h3>

<p>Specifies which federal, state, or local agency to use as a filter.</p>

<p>For federal agencies, the ID is based on <a href="https://schemas.usajobs.gov/Enumerations/AgencySubElement.xml">USAJobs' agency schema</a>. Two letter codes are used to span entire departments, while four letter codes are generally used for independent agencies or agencies within a department.</p>

<p>For state and local agencies, a sample of the format follows.</p>

<p><em>State of Virginia</em><br/>
US-VA</p>

<p><em>State of Virginia Department of Taxation</em><br/>
US-VA:DEPT-TAX</p>

<p><em>Fairfax County, VA</em><br/>
US-VA:COUNTY-FAIRFAX</p>

<p><em>Fairfax County Sheriff</em><br/>
US-VA:COUNTY-FAIRFAX:SHERIFF</p>

<p><em>City of Fairfax, VA</em><br/>
US-VA:COUNTY-FAIRFAX:CITY-FAIRFAX</p>

<p>If you specify an <code>organization_id</code> in your API call but the searcher types in another agency, the searchers' agency overrides the <code>organization_id</code> parameter. For example, VA jobs are returned when you specify Air Force jobs, but the searcher looks for jobs at the VA (<a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=jobs+at+the+va&amp;organization_id=AF">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=jobs+at+the+va&amp;organization_id=AF</a>).</p>

<h3>Hl [highlighting]</h3>

<p>No highlighting is included by default. Use 'hl=1' to highlight terms in the position title that match terms in the user's search. Highlighted terms are surrounded with <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<h3>Size</h3>

<p>Specifies how many results are returned (up to 100 at a time).</p>

<h3>From</h3>

<p>Specifies the starting record.</p>

<h3>Tags</h3>

<p>Specifies the level of government. Current tags are <code>federal</code>, <code>state</code>, <code>county</code>, and <code>city</code>.</p>

<h3>Lat_lon</h3>

<p>Comma-separated pair denoting the position of the searcher looking for a job. For example, 'lat_lon=37.783333,-122.416667' is the value for San Francisco, CA. For generic job searches (e.g., 'jobs', 'internships') where this parameter is passed in, the Jobs API server will sort jobs results and return those that are closest to the searcher's location. For jobs that have multiple locations associated with the position, the distance to the closest location is used to determine the overall geo-distance for the job. Note that for keyword-based job searches (e.g., 'jobs in NY', 'nursing jobs'), this parameter has no effect and is ignored.</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<p>We've tailored this Jobs API for our use in our search results. Data are normalized across government job listings and we don't include all jobs from all data sources. So, we encourage you to use the original data sources directly.</p>

<p>Federal government jobs are from <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov">USAJobs</a>. The USAJobs API for job opportunity announcements is at <a href="https://data.usajobs.gov/Rest">https://data.usajobs.gov/Rest</a>.</p>

<p>State and local government jobs are from cities, counties, and state agencies that use <a href="http://www.neogov.com">NeoGov</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" />, such <a href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/jobs-and-volunteer">jobs with the the city of Boulder, Colorado</a>.</p>

<h2>Testimonials</h2>

<blockquote><p>We encourage the use of shared services across government agencies and we want to make <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">WhiteHouse.gov</a> an example for others to follow. It would not be possible to match the value of GSA's free search service by procuring or building a custom solution. Previously, we needed to dedicate significant resources to configuring and tuning our internal solution, whereas with USASearch, we can now deploy these resources to enhance the features of and technology supporting the White House website.</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>

<p>USASearch got its start when Internet entrepreneur Eric Brewer, whose early research was funded by the Department of Defense, offered to donate a powerful search engine to government. That gift helped accelerate the government's earlier work to create a government-wide portal.</p>

<p>In June 2000, President Clinton announced the gift from the Federal Search Foundation, a nonprofit organization established by Brewer, and instructed that an official U.S. web portal be launched within 90 days. USA.gov went online on September 22, 2000 under the name FirstGov.gov with a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001109105200/http://www.firstgov.gov">prominent search box</a> to allow the public to search across government websites.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the USASearch tool, we are able to deliver a modernized and customer-centric search experience on <a href="http://www.usda.gov">USDA.gov</a>. The service has provided significant improvements to our site search technology and the ability to leverage open source technology and seamlessly integrate with other existing platforms and USDA social and multi-media channels across the web.</p>

<p>We are able to fully manage the tool and reduce the amount of resources needed to maintain an enterprise-wide search solution across the Department.

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/releases/2013-06-21.html"/>
    <updated>2013-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/releases/2013-06-21.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've spent the past few weeks doing some spring cleaning to improve our backend infrastructure and to lay the groundwork for a major update to our Admin Center. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We started using the Rails <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">asset pipeline</a>. As a result of using the pipeline and some of the other chores below, we decreased the page load time by 25 percent.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/0-90-1-released/">Elasticsearch 0.90.1</a>.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/05/14/ruby-2-0-0-p195-is-released">Ruby 2.0.0</a>.</li>
<li>We updated the way we monitor <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/category/passenger/phusion-passenger-4">Phusion Passenger</a>.</li>
<li>We removed some unused tables and columns from our MySQL database.</li>
<li>We removed the legacy recalls code from our codebase now that we've released it as a standalone open source <a href="https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT/recalls_api">Recalls API Server</a>.</li>
<li>We no longer require a valid API key to include API queries in your <a href="/tagged/analytics">site analytics</a>.</li>
<li>We updated our list of synonyms to include fracking and hyrdofracturing as equivalent terms.</li>
<li>The hyperlinks in the Admin Center system alerts are now clickable.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed a regression bug with <a href="https://github.com/haml">Haml</a> and Ruby 2.0.0 that made the background color of the search results the same color as the page background.</li>
<li>We fixed the CSS for the magnifying glass on the search box so that it appears properly in IE7.</li>
<li>We now only show unique descriptions for <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search?organization=cpsc&amp;sort=date">CPSC recalls</a>.</li>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/releases/2013-05-31.html"/>
    <updated>2013-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/releases/2013-05-31.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlight: Search Your Multimedia Galleries</h2>

<p>Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery?</p>

<p>You can now opt to <a href="/sites/manual/rss.html">index MRSS feeds</a> so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.</p>

<p>MRSS is the standard <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss">media RSS specification</a> for syndicating multimedia content. So, even if you don't have an MRSS feed now, it should be easy to generate one as long as your content is in a content management system or other database. MRSS is also the standard specification used by hosted multimedia services such as Flickr, Instagram, Vimeo, and YouTube.</p>

<p>Email us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x55;&#83;&#x41;&#83;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#103;&#x73;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x67;&#111;&#118;">&#x55;&#83;&#x41;&#x53;&#101;&#x61;&#x72;&#99;&#x68;&#x40;&#103;&#x73;&#97;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#x76;</a> if you have any questions about how to set up an MRSS feed to index your multimedia content.</p>

<p>(Thanks, <a href="http://www.usgs.gov">USGS.gov</a> team, for suggesting this new feature!)</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>For each result, searchers now see the URL directly under the title. The order is now title-URL-description. It had previously been title-description-URL.</li>
<li>Searchers using screen readers now hear plain language labels for the search box&mdash;Enter your search term (English) and Ingrese su búsqueda (Spanish).</li>
<li>When searchers opt to allow us to use their location, they now see <a href="/sites/manual/govbox-jobs.html">jobs</a> that are geographically closest them.</li>
<li>Mobile searchers now see your site's display name as the alt tag for your mobile logo.</li>
<li>You can now access jobs data in our <a href="/sites/manual/api.html">search API</a> so that, if you use our API, you can display jobs in your search results.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We updated how we index and store <a href="/sites/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>, including YouTube feeds, so that we index each feed only one time.</li>
<li>We now return a Bad Request message for <a href="/developer/recalls.html">recalls API</a> searches that specify a page greater than 20, which is <a href="https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT/recalls_api/commit/0539ce559cae7c4f9360f56dba91932bc48ebb4c">outside of the allowed range</a>.</li>
<li>When available, we now <a href="https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT/recalls_api/commit/74ff28198b2e09418d9d0826fffdcb99bd7fd22f">pull CPSC's URLs</a> for their recalls from their 301 or 302 response headers.</li>
<li>We now filter out federal jobs with more than 20 locations.</li>
<li>We removed the code for our forms feature on <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and federal forms API. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectMyUSA">@ProjectMyUSA</a> to see how the MyUSA team is working to improve the public's experience with federal forms.</li>
<li>We removed the code that created a separate mobile version of USA.gov. Visit  <a href="http://www.USA.gov">http://www.USA.gov</a> to see its new, responsive design.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed the pagination in our <a href="/sites/manual/api.html">search API</a> so that the API now consistently returns 10 results (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc).</li>
<li>We tweaked the Spanish translations for the <a href="/sites/manual/govbox-jobs.html">jobs GovBox</a>.</li>
<li>We fixed the link for the advanced search operators on the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?affiliate=gobiernousa">Spanish-language advanced search page</a> to point to the corresponding Spanish-language help.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlight: Search Your Twitter Lists</h2>

<p>Does your agency have dozens of Twitter accounts? Do you have a public Twitter list for these accounts? You can now opt to <a href="/sites/manual/twitter.html">index tweets</a> from your lists. You can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show tweets from your Twitter account only (for example, index and show tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/USDA">@USDA</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" /> only)</li>
<li>Show tweets from your account's public lists (for example, index and show tweets from the all members of @USDA's list, <a href="https://twitter.com/USDA/lists/usda-twitter-accounts">USDA Twitter accounts</a> <img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif" alt="External link" />).</li>
</ul>


<p>(Thanks, <a href="http://www.nih.gov">NIH.gov</a> team, for suggesting this new feature!)</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers on Spanish-language websites now see the <a href="/sites/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a> when they search on jobs-related terms. For example, a Jobs GovBox appears on GobiernoUSA.gov for a search on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=gobiernousa&amp;query=trabajos"><em>trabajos</em></a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We updated the cron script for our monthly analytics emails.</li>
<li>We updated our stemming file.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We now correctly identify the Food and Drug Administration or Food Safety and Inspection Service as the data sources in our <a href="/developer/recalls.html">Recalls API</a>.</li>
<li>We fixed how we handle registered trademarks in the <a href="/developer/recalls.html">Recalls API</a> so that searchers can now find items such as Zicam&reg;.</li>
<li>We now provide a better response when an API call specifies the 'doc' index but doesn't include the required, complementary 'dc' parameter.</li>

<p>Searchers on many state and local websites can now see current job openings. We're automatically indexing and displaying job openings for all of your websites that use <a href="http://www.neogov.com">NeoGov</a>.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows current job openings displayed on the City of Bloomington, MN, for a search on <a href="http://search.ci.bloomington.mn.us/search?affiliate=cityofbloomingtonmnsearchresults&amp;query=jobs">jobs</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/jobs-bloomington.png" alt="Search results for jobs on ci.bloomington.mn.us" /></p>

<li>We removed outdated, unused code that allowed you to embed the search results page within an iFrame.</li>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/govbox-jobs.html"/>
    <updated>2013-05-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/sites/manual/govbox-jobs.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common search tasks is to look for current job openings. To help searchers quickly find relevant jobs we've created the Jobs GovBox.</p>

<p>When you <a href="/sites/manual/display-overview.html">turn on the Jobs GovBox</a>, searchers looking for jobs on your site will see up to three relevant jobs listings on your results page.</p>

<h2>Federal Government</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Cross-Agency Portals.</strong> If your website is a federal cross-agency portal (e.g., USA.gov), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all federal agencies</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Department Websites.</strong> If your website is affiliated with a specific federal department (e.g., Department of Commerce), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all agencies within your department</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Agency or Office Websites.</strong> If your website is affiliated with a specific federal agency (e.g., NOAA) or office (e.g, National Ocean Service), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location-and keyword-matched job openings <em>at your agency</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Searchers will also see a direct link to <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov">USAJobs.gov</a> for all current job openings (specific to your department or agency, if applicable), as shown in the sample below for a search on <a href="http://usdasearch.usda.gov/search?affiliate=usda&amp;query=jobs" title=""><em>jobs</em></a> on the USDA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/govbox-jobs.png" alt="Search results for jobs on USDA.gov" /></p>

<h2>State and Local Government</h2>

<p>If your website is a state or local government site that uses both USASearch and NeoGov (e.g., Michigan.gov), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across your agency</em>.</p>

<p>Searchers will also see a direct link to your NeoGov page for all current job openings specific to your agency, as shown in the sample below for a search on <em><a href="http://search.ci.bloomington.mn.us/search?affiliate=cityofbloomingtonmnsearchresults&amp;query=jobs">jobs</a></em> on the City of Bloomington, MN.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/jobs-bloomington.png" alt="Search results for jobs on ci.bloomington.mn.us" /></p>

<p>Otherwise, the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all federal, state, and local agencies</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p> <strong>Did you know?</strong> Are you a federal agency that doesn't post your jobs on USAJobs? Or a local or state government that doesn't use NeoGov? We want your jobs data. E-mail us at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x55;&#x53;&#x41;&#x53;&#x65;&#x61;&#114;&#x63;&#104;&#x40;&#x67;&#115;&#97;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#118;">&#x55;&#x53;&#65;&#83;&#101;&#97;&#x72;&#99;&#104;&#x40;&#103;&#115;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x67;&#111;&#118;</a> to let us know where you publish your job openings so that we can include them in the Jobs GovBox.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/tos.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following terms of service ("Terms") govern the General Services Administration's (GSA) USASearch Program website and services, including the content, documentation, code and related materials, are offered subject to your acceptance of the Terms as well as any relevant sections of the HowTo.gov <a href="http://www.howto.gov/site-policies">Site Policies</a> (collectively, the "Agreement"). Access to or use of USASearch services or its content constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>

<ul>
<li>We don't collect any personally-identifiable information nor use persistent cookies.</li>
<li>When you use USASearch, we store information about searches on your site, including: the web page from which searchers accessed your search results, the date and time, the words searched for, items clicked on a page, and the browser and operating system used. We periodically delete our search logs.</li>
<li>We use this information to measure the usage of our website and services and to identify system performance or problem areas. We also use this information to help us develop the service, analyze patterns of usage, and to make the service more useful. This information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. We may anonymize and provide this information to third-party entities for the purposes of analyzing search traffic.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Secondary Use</h3>

<ul>
<li>Customers using our Search Data API cannot cache results.</li>
<li>Data accessed through our website and services does not, and should not, include controls over its end use.</li>
<li>Once the data has been downloaded from USASearch, we can't vouch for the quality or timeliness of any analyses conducted with data retrieved.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Citing Data</h2>

<p>Customers using the Search Data API must display the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/4/E/04E076D4-60B2-4D31-BCC7-C4805B558DBB/Bing%20product%20guidelines.pdf">Web Results by Bing</a> [PDF] logo on 'web' and 'image' search results pages for attribution of web results. Customers using any of the other three indexes ('docs', 'news', and 'videonews') must display the USASearch logo for attribution instead of the Bing logo.</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<h3>Use of Open Source Software</h3>

<p>USASearch uses open-source software and free or low cost, commercial application programming interfaces when it best meets the needs and mission of GSA.</p>

<h3>Redistribution of Code</h3>

<ol>
<li>Software source code written entirely by GSA staff, and by contractors who are developing software on behalf of GSA, is by default a public domain work.</li>
<li>Software source code previously released under an open source license and then modified by GSA staff is considered a "joint work." It is partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to the terms of the original open-source license.</li>
<li><p>All source code as defined above may be shared with the general public via a highly visible, easily accessible online source code community (such as Github) that facilitates the code's reuse. Source code won't be released if any of the following conditions are met:</p></li>
<li><p>The author of the code determines that the code is too crude to merit distribution or provide value to the broader community.</p></li>
<li>The Government doesn't have the rights to reproduce and release the item. The Government has public release rights when the software is developed by Government personnel, when the Government receives "unlimited rights" in software developed by a contractor at Government expense, or when pre-existing OSS is modified by or for the Government.</li>
<li>The public release of the item is restricted by other law or regulation, such as the Export Administration Regulations or the International Traffic in Arms Regulation.</li>
<li>GSA cybersecurity staff determine that the public release of such code would pose an unacceptable risk to GSA's operational security.</li>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/open-source.html"/>
    <updated>2013-04-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/open-source.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We keep an eye on on our what our government counterparts are up to, both in the U.S. and other countries. We recently came across <a href="https://www.gov.uk">Gov.UK's</a> philosophy on and approach to <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open">coding in the open</a>. It caught our attention and we realized we should also articulate our open source strategy.</p>

<h2>Use and Contribute to Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>Since 2010, we've embraced and leveraged open source software to build our site search service for federal, state, and local government websites. This use of open source has allowed us to experience enormous growth over the past few years. In March 2013 alone, over 24 million searchers received results from our service&mdash;a four-fold increase since March 2010.</p>

<p>Our search service is now a complex system made up of many moving parts, including providing type-ahead search suggestions, serving search results, fetching, indexing, and caching content, and providing analytics.</p>

<p>Each of these parts is compiled into our USASearch codebase and, as we use open source components for our system, we contribute back to the projects.</p>

<h2>Code in the Open</h2>

<p>We recently began to unravel our monolithic codebase so that we can share individual pieces of our code. To borrow the phrase from Gov.UK, we're now <strong><em>coding in the open</em></strong>.</p>

<p>We recently released the code for our <a href="https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT/jobs_api">Jobs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT/recalls_api">Recalls</a> API servers. They're our first foray into coding in the open. The source code for these API servers is in <a href="https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT">our GitHub repo</a> and is available for anyone to see and contribute to.</p>

<p>The data products for this code are also open and available for anyone to consume on our <a href="/developer/index.html">USASearch.HowTo.gov/Developer</a> hub.</p>

<p>These two servers and their underlying data now operate outside of our core search codebase.</p>

<p>Following this same model, moving forward, we plan to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Share first&mdash;For every new feature, we'll write the code so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the code, not just us. If the public community contributes to the codebase, we'll be able to improve this feature without taxing our developers.</p></li>
<li><p>Expose APIs&mdash;We'll expose our data products as APIs so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the data, not just searchers on a government websites.</p></li>
<li><p>Be our own customer&mdash;We'll use our own public code and data just like everyone else. We'll call our own API servers to integrate the data within our search results pages.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Make Things Open to Make Things Better</h2>

<p>We agree with Gov.UK that "to make things open makes things better."</p>

<p>We have finite resources and we don't want to lose our focus on serving our agency customers and improving visitors' search experience on government websites. So, we won't be spending a lot of time to build or support a vibrant community around our code.</p>

<p>That said, we hope that exposing the pieces of our system will be useful to someone somewhere. We'll continue to provide the "ingredients" of our search service so that others will be able to make use of the code and data in ways that we could never imagine.</p>

<h2>And, We're Not Alone</h2>

<p>We're not alone. Other federal agencies have embraced the approach of coding in the open and have <a href="http://gsa.github.io/federal-open-source-repos">GitHub repos</a>. Below are a just a few of our many favorites.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has embraced open source, including serving their public data sets through <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/qu">qu</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>USA.gov recently released the code for their <a href="https://github.com/usagov/usagov-ios-app">iPhone app</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The White House was in the forefront of using open source software in the federal government with their use of Drupal. They're continuing to lead by example by opening up the code for their <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions">We the People petitions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-ios">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-android">Android</a> mobile apps.</p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlight: Show Your Footer</h2>

<p>Do you have information in the footer of your results page that searchers need to see? Searchers can now view or hide the footer while on your search results page.</p>

<p>After clicking on the Show Footer icon located at the bottom right-hand corner of the search results page, searchers will see the footer.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/footer-1.png" alt="Show/hide footer icon" /></p>

<p>They'll still be able to scroll infinitely through the search results while the footer is visible. To hide the footer, they can click on the icon again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighted Feature: Limiting Results to a Subset of Your Content</h2>

<p>Do you want to set up a search box (or even hundreds of search boxes) over a subset of your content?</p>

<p>You can set up a <a href="/sites/manual/collections.html">Collection</a>. Or, you can now pass in a 'sitelimit' parameter to filter the results to specific folders or domains.</p>

<h3>Option 1. Set Up a Collection</h3>

<p>See the sample results page on <a href="http://www.nih.gov">NIH.gov</a> that shows results for a search on <a href="http://search.nih.gov/search/docs?affiliate=nih&amp;dc=565&amp;query=cancer"><em>cancer</em></a> in NIH.gov's New Releases.</p>

<p>Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to News in the left-hand menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/nih-collection.png" alt="Collection-based search results for cancer in NIH.gov news releases" /></p>

<h3>Option 2. Use the Sitelimit Parameter</h3>

<p>Compare the collection-based results above with the results for <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nih&amp;query=cancer&amp;sitelimit=nih.gov/news">the same search using the sitelimit parameter</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to nih.gov/news in a message under the search box, among other differences.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/nih-sitelimit.png" alt="Sitelimit-based search results for cancer in NIH.gov news releases" /></p>

<h2>Other Feature</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers' see job openings in their state <em>before</em> the listings for jobs in other states.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We added sequester/sequestration as an entry in our synonym file so that searchers looking for information on the topic find all relevant results.</li>
<li>We throttled the YouTube RSSFeedFetcher to avoid HTTP 403 errors.</li>
<li>We added some compound indexes to speed up queries.</li>

You can use this option to provide a search box on a small subset of content (such as a policy manual or meeting minutes) while not cluttering up the left-hand navigation on your main results page. (It also helps reduce the likelihood that searchers experience a "dead end" on your main results page.)</li>

<p>The display of search results pages is constantly evolving. Some changes are subtle. Others are more noticeable.</p>

<p>In line with industry best practices and commercial search engines, we've moved the tools for filtering and sorting results to the top of results list (rather than on the left side). We've also added an option to clear all filters.</p>

<p>Searchers can now effectively search for jobs by keyword, agency, state, or work schedule (part-or full-time).</p>


<p>We also focused on not showing the Jobs GovBox when it isn't relevant (for example, it is no longer shown when searchers look for job safety posters or employment verification forms).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Highlighted Feature: Common Search Metrics for the Digital Strategy</em></p>


<p>Do you ever feel like you're drowning in data? Do you feel like finding meaningful insights from the data is like searching for a needle in a haystack? </p>


<p>To standardize and streamline how agencies collect and report this data, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a> requires federal executive branch agencies to implement common performance and customer satisfaction metrics. <a href="http://www.howto.gov">HowTo.gov</a> has published <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/digital-metrics">guidance on common metrics</a>, including describing what you should measure, what to do with the data, and common tools to help you collect and analyze your metrics.</p>


<p>To support you in collecting and reporting your site <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/tagged/analytics">search metrics</a> for the Digital Government Strategy, we've added four new reports to the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites).</p>


<h2>1. Top "no results" queries</h2>


<p>The most popular, valid searches that don't return any results on your site's search results page (e.g., because you don't have the content on your site, or the content isn't findable by the person's search term).<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Review your content to see if you need to add new content, or update existing content to include the words your readers search for.</p>


<h2>2. Top searches with low click through rates</h2>


<p>The most popular search terms that people generally don't act (click) on. Consider incorporating language from these popular search terms into page titles or descriptions, to encourage searchers to click on your relevant page.</p>


<h2>3. Top changing search terms (movement up/down)</h2>


<p>Shows trending topics, what's hot or not. Use this report to investigate why people might be losing interest in once-popular content and consider archiving if it's no longer needed. For newly popular terms, create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete. </p>


<h2>4. Top clicked URLs for specific queries</h2>


<p>The most common results that searchers found most relevant or appealing, for specific search terms. Review these popular pages and other customer top tasks to make sure they are current, accurate, complete and compelling.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good news! We completed a major upgrade of our search infrastructure. You likely didn't notice as we completed the upgrade without any downtime for searchers on your site. </p>


<p>Our system is now even more secure, stable, and redundant than it was before. Plus, it is faster, too. Highlights of the upgrade follow.</p>


<p><em><strong>Multihoming</strong></em></p>


<p>We've always had a disaster recovery, backup datacenter, but it often sat idle. We wanted to make better use of all of our servers so we're now leveraging a content delivery network to send traffic to whichever datacenter is geographically closest to the searcher. This allows us to use both datacenters equally and serve our results quickly.</p>


<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mcd7tbK8RD1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><em><strong>New Hardware</strong></em></p>


<p>We increased our RAM and CPU resources by five times. We have room to grow and to roll out more features.</p>


<p><em><strong>Upgraded Software</strong></em></p>


<p>We're now on Red Hat 6 and Cloudera 4.</p>


<p><em><strong>Speed, Speed, Speed</strong></em></p>


<p>We're always working to improve the speed of our search results. We changed some of our caching rules. We also started to leverage <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> (a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server).</p>

<p>Searchers now have the benefit of infinite scrolling on your results pages. What is infinite scrolling? You've probably used it on many commercial websites, such as <a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=yosemite">Bing Images</a>, <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=yosemite">Duck Duck Go</a>, <a href="http://pinterest.com/search/boards/?q=yosemite">Pinterest</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/yosemite">Twitter</a>. It automatically allows searchers to see more results when they get to the bottom of the page, without clicking on the link for the next page of results.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=yosemite"><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mb2awk8xwU1qid15q.png"/></a></p>


<p>Infinite scrolling has many advantages, including:</p>


<ol><li><em><em>Speed.</em><span> </span></em>The next set of new results loads quicker than a totally new page.</li>
<li><em>Streamlining the user interface.</em> Studies show most searchers don't use the next page buttons. Proactively loading results allows searchers to see more results on one page and to compare them.</li>
<li><em>Simplifying the indexes.</em> When and how we display results from our various web indexes is easier for us, you, and end users. </li>
</ol>


<p><em><strong>Other Features</strong></em></p>


<p>We completely revamped how <a href="/sites/manual/collections.html">collections</a> work to provide you with more flexibility. We encourage you to check out this feature if you're interested in offering  navigation options in the left-hand sidebar on your results page. You can now create a collection:</p>


<ul><li>Covering tens of thousands (or even millions) of web pages.</li>
<li>Covering domains that aren't part of your primary <a href="/sites/manual/domains.html">domain</a> (i.e., that aren't shown on the main web results page). </li>
<li>Without needing to add our Javascript <a href="/sites/manual/code.html">code snippet</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Helping searchers find forms</em></p>


<p>Similar to our existing <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=census+bureau&amp;affiliate=usagov">agency</a> and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=diabetes">health</a> GovBoxes, we created a <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=i9+form">forms</a> GovBox to help searchers find federal government forms. So far, we've included forms from the Department of Defense, General Services Administration, Social Security Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>


<p>We've also published the forms data as a <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/forms.shtml">Federal Forms API</a> for third-party developers.</p>


<p><strong>Chores</strong></p>


<ul><li>We upgraded our robots.txt parser to account for comments and varying cases.</li>
<li>We eliminated support for six <a href="/blog/legacy-domains.html">legacy domains</a> as part of the .gov web reform project.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>


<ul><li>We fixed broken URLs for Best Bets image files.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug with our browser user agent so that Internet Explorer users no longer sometimes see a blank results page.</li>
<li>We fixed a CSS validation bug so you don't see an error message when editing your header or footer.</li>
<li>We updated a broken link for Explore Topics on m.USA.gov.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the federal <a href="http://www.usa.gov/WebReform.shtml">.gov web reform</a> project, we're eliminating six of our legacy domains. Going forward, our only supported domain is search.usa.gov (or search.yoursite.gov, if you've requested <a href="/sites/manual/cname.html">DNS masking</a>).
What do you need to do? If your URL starts with any of the following six legacy domains, you must update your HTML form code.</p>

<ol>
<li>firstgovsearch.gov</li>
<li>searchusa.gov</li>
<li>usasearch.gov</li>
<li>(Spanish) buscador.gov</li>
<li>(Spanish) buscadorusa.gov</li>
<li>(Spanish) usabuscador.gov</li>
</ol>


<p>Specifically, you have to update the action of your <a href="/sites/manual/code.html">form code</a> to call search.usa.gov (or search.yoursite.gov).</p>

<p><code>&lt;form method="get" action="http://search.usa.gov/search"&gt;</code></p>

<p>Note that, if you don't update your form code, your search results page will no longer work.</p>

    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/releases/2012-07-06.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We hope you had a good Fourth of July!</p>


<p>One of your most frequently asked questions is, "What's your roadmap?" We decided to use the halfway point of the year to expand our release notes to include notes on our upcoming features.</p>


<p><strong>Last Week's New Features</strong></p>


<p>We're now displaying Twitter results in the third rail. Searchers like Twitter results because they often contain your latest information. The third rail increases the  visibility of your tweets and it allows searchers to see both Twitter and YouTube results above the fold in the browser.</p>


<p>See the sample results page below that shows social media results on Commerce.gov for a search on<em> <a href="http://search.commerce.gov/search?query=innovation&amp;affiliate=commerce.gov">innovation</a></em>.</p>


<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m71vk4FInR1qid15q.jpg"/></p>


<p><strong>Other Features</strong></p>


<ul><li>You may now enter multiple handles if you have more than one social media account for Flickr, Twitter, or YouTube.</li>
<li>Mobile searchers can see image results.</li>
<li>You may now see whether we've indexed your Twitter or Flickr content.</li>
<li>We now index Microsoft Office documents (Excel, Word, and PowerPoint).</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>


<ul><li>We now label Office documents.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue with Flickr indexing.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Coming Up in July</strong></p>


<p>We "celebrated" during the Fourth of July holiday by focusing on some general housekeeping to ensure stability for the rest of the year. We'll release new features to index secure (https) content. We'll also update our USASearch Tag to power both type-ahead and fetching (eliminating the need for you to have put two sets of USASearch javascript on your web pages).</p>


<p><strong>Coming Up Next Quarter</strong></p>


<p>We divide our roadmap into four categories, and we complete one major feature in each category per quarter.</p>


<p><em>1. Customer Services. </em>We plan to improve and facilitate our signup process. We're going to automatically populate more content when you add a site so it is easier for you to take advantage of new features. We also plan to create a dashboard to allow you to see what has changed within your search configuration.</p>


<p><em>2. Content Sources. </em>You've requested more control to divide search results into content sources, topics, etc. We plan to offer more flexibility to allow you to divide your content as it makes sense for your searchers.</p>


<p><em>3. Core Search. </em>One good (or bad) aspect about search is that there is always more work to do in terms of relevancy, speed, scaling, etc. We plan to focus on tuning these aspects, especially for our newer content sources.</p>


<p><em>4. Search Analytics. </em>We have a growing amount of data, and we want to expose more of it to you. In parallel with providing you just a dashboard in the Admin Center, we plan to proactively notify you of any potential issues.</p>


<p>We hope that this glimpse into our recently released features and our short- and long-term roadmap helps you understand what we're working on and what's coming down the road.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After our migration of Commerce.gov to Drupal, we used the native search tool. However, after looking at the internal site search analytics, it was obvious visitors were not finding what they were looking for. USASearch integrated easily into our system and provided several new features. I appreciate the auto-fill and sort by source features and so do our visitors. Our analytics logs report a much higher percentage of searches resulting in what the visitor was looking for.</p>

<p>Our goal is to do that using the latest technologies available in the most cost effective manner possible. Partnering with USASearch has enabled us to further enhance our capabilities while saving upwards of $214,000 per year from our previous enterprise search system.</p>

<p>USASearch has empowered us with more control over search results to more effectively help our customers quickly and easily find the information they are looking for. Their flexible system allows us to make adjustments with ease and quickly deploy search for new sites, two elements that are crucial to the success of our operations.</p>

<p>Beyond that, we feel that USASearch values their stakeholders and we appreciate their flexibility, attention to detail, and migration assistance. They have been in constant contact with our team, and have adjusted their code numerous times to meet our core mission requirements with nothing less than superlative and reliable results.

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/customers/labor.html"/>
    <updated>2012-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/customers/labor.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year the Department of Labor (DOL) participated in the <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/usability/first-fridays">First Fridays</a> Product Testing Program, a discount usability testing session designed to find and fix usability problems on <a href="http://www.dol.gov">DOL.gov</a>.</p>

<p>The experience led the DOL web team to <a href="http://social.dol.gov/blog/improving-our-website">improve DOL.gov</a>, including changing their search engine.</p>

<p>So it was satisfying to learn that they decided to use USASearch to power the search on DOL.gov. The basis of their decision to select USASearch is exactly what we hope motivates each agency to use USASearch.</p>

<blockquote><p>The 'out of the box' search results are much more relevant than our prior search results because it harnesses the power of a world-class search engine and the program offers us a great amount of control for suggesting the best links for certain search results and ensuring that new content or breaking news is included in the search results.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thank you, DOL!</p>

In the report, Gartner notes that USASearch addresses the key aspects of designing a search system.</p>

<blockquote><p>Gartner identifies key stages of action in "Your Enterprise Search Project: The Outward Spiral." USASearch addressed them all:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Staffing</em> the project with experts who had domain knowledge.</li>
<li><em>Scoping</em> the project using those personnel to satisfy search requirements for federal websites.</li>
<li><em>Selecting</em> the right technology.</li>
<li><em>Implementing</em> it effectively with workers who have the right skill sets.</li>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html"/>
    <updated>2011-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago I rolled my first Hadoop system into production. Since then, I've spoken to quite a few people who are eager to try Hadoop themselves in order to solve their own big data problems. Despite having similar backgrounds and data problems, few of these people have sunk their teeth into Hadoop. When I go to Hadoop Meetups in San Francisco, I often meet new people who are evaluating Hadoop and have yet to launch a cluster. Based on my own background and experience, I have some ideas on why this is the case.</p>


<p>I studied computer science in school and have worked on a wide variety of computer systems in my career, with a lot of focus on server-side Java. I learned a bit about building distributed systems and working with large amounts of data when I built a pay-per-click (PPC) ad network in 2004. The system is still in operation and at one point was handling several thousand searches per second. As the sole technical resource on the system, I had to educate myself very quickly about how to scale up.</p>


<p>As I contemplated how doomed I would be should traffic levels increase much more, I remember wondering to myself, "How does Google deal with all that data?" The answer came to me in the form of the Google File System (GFS) paper and later the MapReduce paper, both from Google. It dawned on me that because Google was forced to solve a much larger problem, they had come up with an elegant solution for a whole range of more modest data problems running on commodity hardware. But it wouldn't be until 2010 that I would get to work with this technology firsthand.</p>


<p>As I wrote in an <a href="/blog/adopting-hadoop.html" target="_blank">earlier article</a>, I started re-architecting <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a>, the U.S. government's search system, in 2009 based on a solution stack of free, open source software including Ruby on Rails, Solr, and MySQL. A wave of déja vu hit me as I started worrying about what to do with the growing mountain of data piling up in MySQL and our increasing need to analyze it in different ways. I had heard that a new company called Cloudera, founded by some big data people from Yahoo!, Google, and Facebook, was making Hadoop available for the masses in a reliable distribution, much in the same way that RedHat did for Linux. Curiosity got the best of me and I bought the newly minted <em>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</em> from O'Reilly. The most insightful part of the book to me was the very first sentence. It's a quote from Grace Hopper: "In pioneer days, they used oxen for heavy pulling, and when one ox couldn't budge a log, they didn't try to grow a bigger ox." I didn't want to grow a bigger server; I wanted to harness a bunch of small servers together to work in unison. The more I learned the more curious I got, so I started reading more. And that's when I hit my first roadblock.</p>


<p>I think people who have been working with Hadoop technologies for years and years sometimes forget just how rich and diverse the big data software ecosystem has become, and how daunting it can be to folks approaching it for the first time. When people at the Meetups say they are evaluating solutions to their data scaling problem, the answers they hear sound something like this: "Just use Hadoop Hive Pig Mahout Avro HBase Cassandra Oozie Sqoop Flume ZooKeeper Cascading NoSQL RCFile. Oh, almost forgot…cloud."</p>


<p>The thought of wading through all of that just to learn about what I needed to learn about was a bit too overwhelming for me, so I put the whole matter aside for a few months. Over time, I started to dive into each of these projects to understand the primary use case, how active the developer community was and which organizations were using it in production. I converged on the idea of using Hive as a warehouse for our data. I opted for Cloudera's distribution since I wanted to reduce the risk of running into compatibility issues between all the various subsystems. Having tracked down anomalies in a highly multi-threaded and contentious distributed Java system before, I liked the idea of someone else taking on that problem for me.</p>


<p>At some point, I had read everything I could read and grew impatient to get my hands dirty, so I decided to just download CDH3 on my laptop and give it a try. The tutorial instructions for the standalone version worked, and I successfully computed more digits of pi than I ever thought I'd need. After creating some sample data in Hive and running a few queries, I felt pretty confident that Hive would be the right tool for the job. I just needed to find somewhere to install and run HDFS (namenode, secondary namenode, and data nodes), Hadoop (jobtracker and tasktracker nodes), Hive, and Hue for a nice front end to it all.</p>


<p>I knew from my past experience how to stretch the limits of CPU, disk, IO, and memory on commodity servers, and I identified a few potential servers at our primary datacenter with resources I figured I could leverage. Once again I followed the tutorial instructions, this time for the fully distributed version of CDH3, and once again I started to compute pi. And that's when I hit my second roadblock. It took me a few days to figure out that I had a problem with DNS. Each machine needs to be able to resolve every other machine's name and IP in the cluster. Whether you do that via /etc/hosts or a local DNS server is up to you, but it needs to happen or the whole thing gets wedged. Once I got that sorted out, everything just started falling into place and I had Hive working in production within a few days. A week later, I started pulling out the MySQL jobs and deleting big tables, and that's been the trend ever since.</p>


<p>Over time, I've gone on to learn about using custom Ruby mappers in Hive, moving data back and forth between MySQL and Hive with Sqoop, and getting the data into HDFS in real-time with Flume. All of these components from the Cloudera distribution are working nicely in our production environment now, and I sleep well at night knowing I have such a solid, deliberate plan for growth. My initial investment in learning about the Hadoop ecosystem is really paying dividends, but when I think about all those people at the Meetups stuck in evaluation mode, I feel their pain. Does it have to be such a struggle?</p>


<p>The big challenge in my opinion is not that any one piece of the puzzle is too difficult. Any reasonably smart (or in my case stubborn) engineer can set themselves on the task of learning about a new technology once they know that it needs to be learned. The challenge with the Hadoop ecosystem is that it presents the newbie with the meta-problem of figuring out which of these tools are appropriate for their use case at all, and whether or not to even consider the problem today versus deferring it until later. In a way Facebook has it easy, because when you are adding 15TB of data per day, that decision is pretty much made for you.</p>


<p>For all the companies sitting in the twilight between the gigabyte and the petabyte who don't have Hadoop expertise in-house, there is a collection of free information to help guide people to the right solution space (Hadoop Tutorial, White Papers). These days, when I talk to people who are evaluating solutions to their big data problems, my advice to them is to break down their problems into a few discrete use cases and then work on ferreting out the technologies that are designed for that use case. Get a proof of concept to demonstrate that the technology can address your use case and convince yourself and others that you're on the right track. Work toward putting something simple into production. Lather, rinse, and repeat. I am still in that cycle myself, as these days I'm exploring HBase and OpenTSDB to give me low-latency access to time series data and Mahout to do frequent item set mining, but that's another article for another day.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The USASearch tool is awesome. It makes finding things on our website easier than ever. The results that come back are both quick and relevant. My favorite feature has to be Query Logs. What our users are looking for is now crystal clear, which makes my life way easier. It provides insight into what users want that is sometimes very hard to find. It also allows us to promote the correct content.</p>

<p>For instance, for several months our most search terms were employment and jobs, so we created a Jobs page and put it right on our homepage. After that the search for those terms dropped dramatically, which means users no longer had to poke and search for Jobs/Employment information because it was right where it needed to be.</p>

<p>I almost couldn't believe that this amazing service is free. It's easy to implement and full of useful features, which would normally cost us quite a lot and in this economy it's these types of services that help us save money.</p>

It would not be possible to match the value of GSA's free search service by procuring or building a custom solution. Previously, we needed to dedicate significant resources to configuring and tuning our internal solution, whereas with USASearch, we can now deploy these resources to enhance the features of and technology supporting the White House website.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>InformationWeek</em> yesterday <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/galleries/government/leadership/231600939">recognized 15 government agencies</a> for taking on ambitious IT initiatives in an effort to provide better services at a lower cost.</p>

<p>Former federal CIO Vivek Kundra talked often about the technology gap that separates government workers from private-sector employees. Federal, state, and local government agencies have many initiatives under way in an effort to close that gap.</p>

<p>They're employing cloud computing, software as a service, the Web, mobile technologies, and more to give government workers the tools they need to be more productive and to deliver public services more efficiently.</p>

<p>GSA's USASearch was one of those honored by <em>InformationWeek</em> for making government services in English and in Spanish more accessible online with a revamped version of USASearch and its set of advanced search technologies for <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a>. Noted was our use of Microsoft's Bing Index, open source technologies such MySQL, Hadoop, and OpenCalais, and employing agile development to deliver new features quickly.</p>

<p>The award also cited our affiliate program which now includes hundreds of government websites that share our services and data through the platform. This affiliate program offers free search services to any federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government agency. Affiliates can create a customized search experience that best fits their clients' needs through a simple, online administrative console.</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/adopting-hadoop.html"/>
    <updated>2011-06-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/adopting-hadoop.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>


<p>The United States federal government's <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch program</a> provides hosted search services for government affiliate organizations, shares APIs and web services, and operates the government's official search engine at Search.USA.gov. The USASearch affiliate program offers free search services to any federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government agency. Several hundred websites make use of this service, ranging from the smallest municipality to larger federal sites like <a href="http://weather.gov" target="_blank">weather.gov</a> and <a href="http://usa.gov" target="_blank">usa.gov</a>. The USASearch program leverages the Bing API as the basis for its web results and then augments the user search experience by providing a variety of government-centric information such as related search topics and highlighted editorial content. The entire system is comprised of a suite of open-source tools and resources, including Apache Solr/Lucene, OpenCalais, and Apache Hadoop. Of these, our usage of Hadoop is the most recent. We began using <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop/" target="_blank">Cloudera's Distribution including Apache Hadoop</a> (<a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop" target="_blank">CDH3</a>) for the first time in the Fall, and since then we've seen our usage grow every month— not just in scale, but in scope as well. But before highlighting everything the USASearch program is doing with Hadoop today, I should explain why we began using it in the first place.</p>


<p><strong>Phase 1: Search analytics</strong></p>


<p>All of the search and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/api" target="_blank">API</a> traffic across hundreds of affiliate sites, iPhone apps, and widgets comes through a single search service, and this generates a lot of data. To improve the service, administrators wanted to see aggregated information on what sorts of information searchers were looking for, how well they were finding it, what trends were forming, and so on. Once searches were initiated, they also wanted to know what results were shown and then what results were clicked on. They wanted to see all this information broken down by affiliate over time, and also aggregated across the entire affiliate landscape.</p>


<p>The initial system, like many initial systems, was fairly simple and did just enough to address our most pressing analytics needs. We took the logs from Apache and Ruby on Rails, put them in a big MySQL database on a separate machine, ran nightly and monthly jobs on them, and then exported the summary results to the main database cluster to be served up via a low-latency Rails web interface for analytics. We used a separate physical database machine with lots of memory and disk for the batch processing to keep our production MySQL instances from being impacted by this resource-intensive batch processing.</p>


<p><img alt="Diagram showing the initial dataflow of raw logfiles to analytics apps" src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lle73iJ2Ts1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p>As we watched the main database tables grow and the nightly batch jobs take longer and longer, it became clear that we would soon exhaust the resources available on the single database analytics processing node. We looked at scaling up the hardware vertically and sharding the database horizontally, but both options seemed like we were just kicking the can down the road. Larger database hardware would be both costly and eventually insufficient for our needs, and sharding promised to take all the usual issues associated with a single database system (backups, master/slaves, schema management) and multiply them. We wanted the system to be able to grow cost effectively and without downtime, be naturally resilient to failures, and have backups handled sensibly. It was at this point that we started investigating HDFS, Hadoop, and Apache Hive.</p>


<p>HDFS offered us a distributed, resilient, and scalable filesystem while Hadoop promised to bring the work to where the data resided so we could make efficient use of local disk on multiple nodes. Hive, however, really pushed our decision in favor of a Hadoop-based system. Our data is just unstructured enough to make traditional RDBMS schemas a bit brittle and restrictive, but has enough structure to make a schema-less NoSQL system unnecessarily vague. Hive let us compromise between the two— it's sort of a "SomeSQL" system.</p>


<p>But best of all, we could layer the entire Cloudera stack on top of a subset of our existing production machines. By making use of each machine's excess reserve capacity of disk, CPU, and RAM, we were able to get a small proof-of-concept cluster stood up without purchasing any new hardware. The initial results confirmed that our workload lent itself well to distributed processing, as one job went from taking over an hour on a MySQL node to 20 minutes on a three machine Hadoop cluster. Within a week of getting the prototype up and running, we had transitioned all the remaining nightly analytics batch SQL jobs into Hive scripts. The job output fed into a collection of intermediate Hive tables, from which we generated summary data to export to MySQL as low-latency tables for the Rails web interface to use. To prove the scaling point, we spent five minutes adding another datanode/tasktracker to the mix, kicked off the cluster rebalancer, and the whole process ran faster the next day.</p>


<p><img alt="Diagram showing the current dataflow of raw logfiles to analytics apps" src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lle73rea1K1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><strong>Phase 2: Feedback loop</strong></p>


<p>The result of all this analysis in Hive shows up not just in various analytics dashboards, but as part of the search experience on many government websites, too. For example, compare the different type-ahead suggestions for ‘<strong>gran</strong>' on <a href="http://nps.gov/">nps.gov</a> and <a>usa.gov</a>. Both sites use the same USASearch backend system, but the suggestions differ completely. We use Hadoop to help us generate contextually relevant and timely search suggestions for hundreds of government sites like this.</p>


<p><img alt="Image showing different type-ahead suggestions on NPS.gov and USA.gov" src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lle73ymed31qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><strong>Phase 3: Internal monitoring</strong></p>


<p>Shortly after moving our event stream analysis from MySQL to Hadoop/Hive, we noticed a change in how we thought about data. Freed from the constant anxiety of wondering how we were going to handle an ever-increasing amount of data, we shifted from trying to store only what we really needed to storing whatever we thought might be useful. We first turned our attention to the performance data emitted by the various sub-systems that make up the search program.</p>


<p>Each search results page is potentially made up of many data modules sintered together from calls to the Bing API, our own Solr indexes, a MySQL cluster, and a Redis cache. A small latency problem with any one of them can propagate through the system to create much larger problems, so we want to have a deep knowledge of how each subsystem behaves throughout the day under various circumstances. We were already monitoring the availability of all these services with Opsview, but we had no insight into their performance over time. Whenever we sensed a problem ("Is one of the Solr indexes getting slow?"), we would liberally apply ssh, tail -f, and grep to try to see what was going on. This seemed like a good use case for Hive, so in the case of Solr, for example, we threw the compressed log files into HDFS, wrote a simple SerDe regular expression to define rows in a Hive table partitioned by date, and built a view on top of that for easy manipulation of extracted columns such as the Solr index name and the hour of day. Hive makes it trivially easy to do some fairly sophisticated aggregate analysis on the response times for each Solr index, such as generating a distribution histogram, or calculating the pth percentile.</p>


<p>Some of these Hive queries are not run very often— perhaps just a few times a month— so we don't want to spend time building them into our test-driven Rails analytics framework. On the other hand, they are complex enough that we don't want to rewrite them every time we want to use them. For these cases, we use Beeswax in HUE to save off parameterized queries that can then be shared among engineers or analysts to run on an ad hoc basis.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>


<p>In the space of a few months, we've gone from having a brittle and hard-to-scale RDBMS-based analytics platform to a much more agile Hadoop-based system that was designed to scale intrinsically. We continue to see our Hadoop usage grow in scope with each new data source we add, and it's clear that we'll be relying on it more and more in the future as the suite of tools and resources around Hadoop grows and matures.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While USASearch is for all levels of government (federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial), most of our customers come from the federal sector. So, we are showcasing a highly-trafficked county site to show how other levels of government successfully leverage our site search service.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.broward.org">Broward County, Florida</a> has a popular web site that serves thousands of multi-lingual users from the Miami metropolitan area.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/customers-broward.png" alt="Broward.org homepage" /></p>

<p>We want to thank Rob Nadeau (Web Site Manager for Broward County) for being a good and supportive customer and someone who proactively implements our special features!</p>

<p>Rob offered these kind words about USASearch.</p>

<blockquote><p>When USASearch expanded their affiliate program, <a href="http://www.broward.org">Broward County</a> was fortunate to be the first County in the nation to participate in the effort. During times when budgets are limited, the partnership monetarily saved the County by not moving to a commercial search solution. As the program evolved to "new" technology and tools, the County and our visitors once again benefited from an ever-growing feature rich program that now offers a more accurate search with speed 9 times faster.</p>

<ul>
<li>a customized look and feel</li>
<li>the ability to immediately boost content to showcase specific pages to appear above the main results</li>
<li>type-ahead search suggestions for visitors to our site</li>
<li>the ability to add and remove search suggestions</li>
<li>the ability to generate reports</li>
</ul>


<p>Thank you for a program that keeps on giving.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thank you, Rob, and everyone please help us spread the word about USASearch to all levels of government.</p>
