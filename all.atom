    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > URLs &amp; Sitemaps</p>

<p>We offer two ways for you to tell us about the web pages that you want us to fetch and include in our index.</p>

<h2>Discovery Tag</h2>

<p>The surest way to ensure we have complete and timely coverage of your content in our index is to add our <a href="/manual/get-code.html">USASearch tag</a> to your web pages. Visit our <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>, select your site, and click on the Get Code option in the left-hand menu.</p>

<p>For more details, read our post on <a href="/manual/get-code.html">How to Add Our Code to Your Website</a>.</p>

<h2>Specific URLs</h2>

<p>Tell us the specific URLs you'd like us to fetch and index. Use the Bulk Upload option to upload a text file with up to 10,000 URLs.</p>

<h2>Crawl Report</h2>

<p>View a report of all previously crawled URLs by clicking on the View All button to browse the list in your browser, or click on the Export to CSV button to download the list as a comma delimited file.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Are you having trouble creating a list of your URLs? E-mail us at USASearch@gsa.gov and we can help identify specific URLs on your site.</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report for your PDF that says, "No content found in document"? Your PDF is likely an image-only, non-searchable file that was created from a paper document using a scanner. See the resources below for more information on how to create searchable PDF files.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2007/02/is_that_pdf_sea/">Is that PDF Searchable?</a> (blog post)</li>
<li><a href="http://acrobatusers.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-searchable-pdf-file">How to Create Searchable PDF File</a> (video)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report that says your page is taking too long to load? Use <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/">Pingdom Tools Full Page Test</a> to test the load time of your page, analyze it, and find the bottlenecks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Tell us the location of your XML sitemap(s). A sitemap is a recommended best practice for search engine optimization. Visit <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org">Sitemaps.org</a> for more details on how to create an XML sitemap.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> We follow the <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">robots exclusion protocol</a> when fetching and indexing your pages. Be sure to allow our user agent (usasearch) to access content you'd like in our index. (Conversely, you can also disallow our agent for any content you'd like to exclude from our index.)</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> To help the public find your web pages when they search on Bing.com, we notify Bing™ about any URLs you add. While this helps with search engine optimization (SEO), it is not a cure-all. You still must register for and use commercial search engines' webmaster tools.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Add Our Code to Your Website]]></title>
    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/get-code.html"/>
    <updated>2013-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/get-code.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Get Code</p>

<p>Visit our <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>, select your site, and click on the Get Code option in the left-hand menu.</p>

<p>Add the following two snippets of code to your website to "hook" your website and our hosted search service together. You can add this code to your individual web pages or to the template(s) in your content management system.</p>

<h2>1. Form Snippet</h2>

<p>Include the first snippet of code where the form for your search box appears. Your form should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>2. Javascript Snippet</h2>

<p>Include the second snippet of code before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. This tag enables type-ahead search and ensures we have complete and timely coverage of your content in our index. Your tag should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
      var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };

      var script = document.createElement("script");
      script.type = "text/javascript";
      script.src = "http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
      document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);

//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> If your website is secured with https, you can add 's' to the two URLs above (i.e., <a href="https://search.usa.gov/search">https://search.usa.gov/search</a> and <a href="https://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js">https://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js</a>, respectively) so that searchers don't receive a security message in Internet Explorer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> If you're using Drupal, be sure to check out our <a href="http://drupal.org/project/USASearch">USASearch Drupal module</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> We offer DNS masking, which allows you to show searchers your domain (instead of USA.gov). Follow these three steps to mask your domain.</p>

<ol>
<li>E-mail us at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x55;&#83;&#x41;&#x53;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#x40;&#x67;&#x73;&#x61;&#46;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;">&#85;&#x53;&#65;&#83;&#x65;&#x61;&#114;&#99;&#x68;&#64;&#103;&#115;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;</a> and ask us to mask your domain.</li></li>
<li>Create a CNAME in your DNS records for <em>search.yoursite.gov</em>. Point it to <em>search.usa.gov.edgekey.net</em>.</li>
<li>When the setup is complete, change the code for your form action from <em>search.usa.gov</em> to <em>search.yoursite.gov</em>.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can set up one site in your USASearch account that limits results to specific folders or subdomains by either:</p>

<p>(1) <a href="/manual/collections.html">Creating a collection</a>.</p>

<p>Create a collection. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to <code>action="http://search.usa.gov/search/docs/</code> and (b) add an input for this collection.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;. 
</code></pre>

<p>The value is the number for your collection ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your collection in the Admin Center as shown in the sample below.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/get-code-collection.png" alt="Value for the collection ID" /></p>

<p>(2) <a href="/manual/rss.html">Setting up an RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>Set up an RSS feed. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to <code>action="http://search.usa.gov/search/news/</code> and (b) add an input for this feed.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###"&gt;. 
</code></pre>

<p>The value is the number for your RSS ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit or preview your feed in the Admin Center.</p>

<p>(3) Leaving your domain blank on the <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> page and, instead, passing a hidden value for the domain in the search form code.</p>

<p>See, for example, <a href="http://www.ri.gov">RI.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.dmv.ri.gov/">DMV.RI.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.health.ri.gov/">Health.RI.gov</a>. On Health.RI.gov, the following hidden value is added to limit to only the health subdomain.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="site" value="www.health.ri.gov" &gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Testimonials</h2>

<blockquote><p>We encourage the use of shared services across government agencies and we want to make <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">WhiteHouse.gov</a> an example for others to follow. It would not be possible to match the value of GSA's free search service by procuring or building a custom solution. Previously, we needed to dedicate significant resources to configuring and tuning our internal solution, whereas with USASearch, we can now deploy these resources to enhance the features of and technology supporting the White House website.</p>

<p><a name="overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2></p>

<p>When you're buying and using products, safety comes first.</p>

<p>Six federal regulatory agencies issue recalls on <a href="http://www.recalls.gov">Recalls.gov</a>.</p>

<p>This Recalls API allows you to tap into a list of (1) drug and food safety recalls from <a href="http://www.FoodSafety.gov">FoodSafety.gov</a>; (2) car safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>; and (3) product safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a>.</p>

<p>This API is great for consumer safety websites or applications, news organizations, and websites or magazines targeted to specific audiences, such as parents.</p>

<p><a name="using-the-api"></a><h2>Using the API</h2></p>

<p>This Recalls API accepts a GET request.</p>

<p>Recalls are searchable by keyword, issuing agency, date, UPC code, vehicle-specific attributes, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>The base URL is http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?<strong>parameter</strong></p>

<p>Sample API requests follow.</p>

<p>All recalls<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?</a></p>

<p>All cribs<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs</a></p>

<p>All cribs that pose a choking hazard<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking</a></p>

<p>All cribs that pose a choking hazard sorted by date<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking&amp;sort=date">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking&amp;sort=date</a></p>

<p><a name="parameters"></a><h2>Parameters</h2></p>

<p>Seven generic parameters are accepted: (1) <code>query</code>, (2) <code>organization</code>, (3) <code>start_date</code>, (4) <code>end_date</code>, (5) <code>page</code>, (6) <code>per_page</code>, and (7) <code>sort</code>. There are additional parameters that are specific to food, product, and car safety recalls. None are required.</p>

<h3>query</h3>

<p>Attempts to extract as much "signal" as possible from the input text. Handles word variants, so a search on "choke" will find a recall categorized as a "choking" hazard.</p>

<h3>organization</h3>

<p>Specifies which agency issued the recall. Possible values are <code>CDC</code>, <code>CPSC</code>, or <code>NHTSA</code>.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?organization=nhtsa">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?organization=nhtsa</a></p>

<h3>start_date</h3>

<p>Specifies the start date of the recall.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?start_date=2012-01-01">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?start_date=2012-01-01</a></p>

<h3>end_date</h3>

<p>Specifies the end date of the recall.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?end_date=2012-12-31">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?end_date=2012-12-31</a></p>

<h3>page</h3>

<p>Specifies the pagination of search results. Possible values are <code>1</code> to <code>20</code>.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?page=3">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?page=3</a></p>

<h3>per_page</h3>

<p>Specifies the number of search results for each page. Possible values are <code>1</code> to <code>50</code>.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?per_page=10">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?per_page=10</a></p>

<h3>sort</h3>

<p>Results are sorted by relevance by default. Possible values are <code>rel</code> or <code>date</code>. Use 'sort=date' to sort results by date with the most recent listed first.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?sort=date">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?sort=date</a></p>

<h3>food_type</h3>

<p>Only for FoodSafety.gov recalls. Specifies the type of recall from FoodSafety.gov. Possible values are <code>food</code> or <code>drug</code>.</p>

<p><a name="overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2></p>

<p>The unemployment rate has hovered around 8 percent since early 2012. So, not surprisingly, many people are hitting the web to search for jobs.</p>

<p>Federal, state, and local government agencies are hiring and have thousands of job openings across the country.</p>

<p>This Jobs API allows you to tap into a list of current jobs openings with the government. Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>This API is great for job websites or applications, job banks, and career counseling and placement applications.</p>

<p><a name="using-the-api"></a><h2>Using the API</h2></p>

<p>This Jobs API accepts a GET request.</p>

<p>Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>The base URL is http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?<strong>parameter</strong></p>

<p>Sample API requests follow.</p>

<p>All nursing jobs<br>
  <a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs</a>

</p>


<p><a name="parameters"></a><h2>Parameters</h2></p>

<p>Five parameters are accepted: (1) query, (2) organization_id, (3) hl [highlighting], (4) size,
  and (5) from. Only query is required.</p>

<h3>Query</h3>

<p>Attempts to extract as much "signal" as possible from the input text. Handles word variants, so
a search on "nursing jobs" will find a job titled "nurse practitioner" and "RN." When parts of
the query parameter are used to search against the position title, the results are ordered by
relevance. When no query parameter is specified, they are ordered by date with the most recent
listed first.</p>

<p>Sample query formats follow.</p>

<h4>All jobs (by date)</h4>




<ul>
  <li>jobs</li>
  <li>positions</li>
  <li>vacancies</li>
  <li>opportunities</li>
  <li>postings</li>
</ul>




<h4>Location-based (by date)</h4>




<ul>

  <li>jobs in fulton, md</li>
  <li>jobs in fulton, maryland</li>
  <li>jobs in md</li>
  <li>pentagon jobs</li>
  <li>jobs fayetteville</li>

  <li>va jobs # will match jobs in Virginia</li>
</ul>




<h4>Keyword-based (by relevance)</h4>




<ul>

  <li>summer internship position</li>
</ul>




<h4>Schedule-based (by date)</h4>




<ul>
  <li>part-time jobs</li>
  <li>full-time positions</li>
</ul>




<h4>Combinations (by relevance)</h4>




<ul>
  <li>part-time security guard job openings at the tsa in los angeles, ca</li>
</ul>




<h3>Organization_id</h3>


<p>Specifies which federal agency to use as a filter, based on
<a href="https://schemas.usajobs.gov/Enumerations/AgencySubElement.xml">USAJobs' agency
schema</a>. Two letter codes are used to span entire departments, while four letter codes are
generally used for independent agencies or agencies within a department.</p>

<p>If you specify an organization_id in your API call but the searcher types in another agency,
the searchers' agency overrides the organization_id parameter. For example, VA jobs are returned
when you specify Air Force jobs, but the searcher looks for jobs at the VA (<a
href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=jobs+at+the+va&amp;organization_id=AF">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=jobs+at+the+va&amp;organization_id=AF</a>).</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/raw-logs.html"/>
    <updated>2013-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/raw-logs.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Raw Logs Access</p>

<p>You can directly access your raw HTTP logs. The logs include valuable data on searches, clicks, and USASearch tag page loads.</p>

<p>With the raw logs, you can conduct in-depth, ad hoc analyses to answer any questions that you can't answer using the standard analytics reports in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>. You can also automatically integrate your search logs with your other reports and business processes.</p>

<p>To access your raw logs, you'll first need to upload your public key on the Raw Logs Access page in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<p>We'll set up your public key on our secure FTP servers and send you an email when your logs are available for download.</p>

<p>Once your key is set up, you'll be able access your log files via secure FTP. We upload your logs each day, usually within several hours after midnight GMT. After a week, we purge the older files.</p>

<p>We recommend that you set up a cron script to automatically download the latest files each day.</p>

<h2>How to Generate a Key Pair on Unix</h2>

<p>On Unix systems, you can generate a RSA public key with no passphrase by typing in the following command. Generate the key from the machine or server that you'll be using to download the logs. Once you've created a key, it'll be located at /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</p>

<pre><code>% cd ~
% ssh-keygen -q -b 4096 -t rsa
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
</code></pre>

<h2>How to Generate a Key Pair on Windows</h2>

<p>You can use <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>, a free telnet/SSH client, to generate a public key on Windows. Download PuTTYgen.exe, Pageant.exe, and PSFTP.exe from the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY Download Page</a>.</p>

<p>Run PuTTYgen.exe.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select SSH-2 RSA as the type of key to generate.</li>
<li>Set the number of bits in the generated key to 2048.</li>
<li>Select Generate. Move your mouse within the blank area to create random movements until the key is generated.</li>
<li>Fill out your Key Comment, Key Passphrase, and Confirm Passphrase.</li>
<li>Copy your <em>public</em> key from the string in the Public Key for Pasting into OpenSSH Authorized_keys File. Paste this key into the Raw Logs Access page in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>. (Note: Don't save this public key and send us the string copied from a text file. It adds lines in the file so it doesn't work.)</li>
<li>Save your <em>private</em> key.</li>
</ul>


<p>Run Pageant.exe. Select Add Key and upload your private key, the .ppk file.</p>

<p>Run PSFTP.exe and type in the following. You can find your site's handle on the Site Information page in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>.</p>

    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/govbox-jobs.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common search tasks is to look for current job openings. To help searchers quickly find relevant jobs we've created the Jobs GovBox.</p>

<p>When you <a href="/manual/results-modules.html">turn on the Jobs GovBox</a>, searchers looking for jobs on your site will see up to three relevant jobs listings on your results page.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Department Websites</strong> If your website is affiliated with a specific federal department (e.g., Department of Commerce), the federal Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all agencies within your department</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Agency or Office Websites</strong> If your website is affiliated with a specific federal agency (e.g., NOAA) or office (e.g, National Ocean Service), the federal Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location-and keyword-matched job openings <em>at your agency</em>.</li>
<li><strong>State and Local Websites and Cross-Agency Portals</strong> If your website is a state or local government site or a federal cross-agency portal (e.g., USA.gov), the federal Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all federal agencies</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Searchers will also see a direct link to <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov">USAJobs.gov</a> for all current job openings (specific to your department or agency, if applicable) , as shown in the sample below for a search on <a href="http://usdasearch.usda.gov/search?affiliate=usda&amp;query=jobs" title=""><em>jobs</em></a> on the USDA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_inline_mhpcdd93lO1qz4rgp.png" alt="Search results for jobs on USDA.gov" /></p>

<hr />

<p> <strong>Did you know?</strong> Are you a local or state government? Or a federal agency that doesn't post your jobs on USAJobs? We want your jobs data. E-mail us at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x55;&#83;&#x41;&#x53;&#101;&#x61;&#114;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#103;&#x73;&#x61;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;">&#85;&#83;&#65;&#83;&#x65;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#x67;&#x73;&#x61;&#x2e;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;</a> to let us know where you publish your job openings so that we can include them in the Jobs GovBox.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighted Feature: Limiting Results to a Subset of Your Content</h2>

<p>Do you want to set up a search box (or even hundreds of search boxes) over a subset of your content?</p>

<p>You can set up a <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collection</a>. Or, you can now pass in a 'sitelimit' parameter to filter the results to specific folders or domains.</p>

<h3>Option 1. Set Up a Collection</h3>

<p>See the sample results page on <a href="http://www.nih.gov">NIH.gov</a> that shows results for a search on <a href="http://search.nih.gov/search/docs?affiliate=nih&amp;dc=565&amp;query=cancer"><em>cancer</em></a> in NIH.gov's New Releases.</p>

<p>Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to News in the left-hand menu.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/nih-collection.png" alt="Collection-based search results for cancer in NIH.gov news releases" /></p>

<h3>Option 2. Use the Sitelimit Parameter</h3>

<p>Compare the collection-based results above with the results for <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nih&amp;query=cancer&amp;sitelimit=nih.gov/news">the same search using the sitelimit parameter</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to nih.gov/news in a message under the search box, among other differences.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/nih-sitelimit.png" alt="Sitelimit-based search results for cancer in NIH.gov news releases" /></p>

<h2>Other Feature</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers' see job openings in their state <em>before</em> the listings for jobs in other states.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We added sequester/sequestration as an entry in our synonym file so that searchers looking for information on the topic find all relevant results.</li>
<li>We throttled the YouTube RSSFeedFetcher to avoid HTTP 403 errors.</li>
<li>We added some compound indexes to speed up queries.</li>
<li>We added JSONP support for the <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/developer/jobs.html">Jobs API</a> and <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/developer/recalls.html">Recalls API</a>.</li>
<li>We investigated additional sources for jobs openings, such as the Department of Labor's <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/DOL-SUMMERJOBS-SERVICE.htm">Summer Jobs</a> and the National Resource Directory's <a href="https://www.nrd.gov/home/api/veterans_job_search">Veterans Jobs Bank</a>.</li>
<li>We moved the publishing platform for <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch.HowTo.gov</a> from Tumblr to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Visitors to eForms.gov, FedForms.gov, and Forms.gov are now automatically redirected to the USA.gov's list of <a href="http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Reference-Shelf/forms.shtml">government forms by agency</a>.</li>
<li>We tuned the redirect on search.usa.gov/images so that all needed images show up on results pages.</li>

    <updated>2013-01-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/releases/2013-01-25.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighted Feature</h2>


<p>This week we buckled down and analyzed data on jobs-related searches to ensure that the new federal <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a> lists the <span>most relevant </span><span>job openings. </span></p>


<p>Searchers can now effectively search for jobs by keyword, agency, state, or work schedule (part-or full-time).</p>


<p>We also focused on not showing the Jobs GovBox when it isn't relevant (for example, it is no longer shown when searchers look for job safety posters or employment verification forms).</p>


<h2>Chores</h2>


<ul><li><span>We added our posting channel ID to all USAJobs links.</span></li>
<li><span>We set up a cron job to fetch and process job files from USAJobs.</span></li>
<li><span>We added impression and click tracking for the federal Jobs GovBox module.</span></li>
<li><span>We resolved performance discrepancy between our <a href="/releases/2012-10-19.html">two datacenters</a>.</span></li>
<li><span>We no longer use XML sitemaps to add documents to the USASearch web index.</span></li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>


<ul><li><span>You can now delete keywords from text best bets.</span></li>
<li><span>Newly added misspellings are now being applied to type-ahead suggestions.</span></li>
<li><span><span>Searchers can now find jobs in non-standard state locations (for example someone searching for jobs in Washington, DC, will find postings the the location of Washington DC Metro Area, District of Columbia)</span><span>.</span></span></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighted Feature: The federal Jobs GovBox</h2>


<p>We're excited to announce that searchers looking for jobs on your site can now see all of your agency's current job openings.</p>


<p>Our new federal <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs Govbox</a> displays up to three location- and keyword-matched job openings on your results page. For more information on how to turn on this GovBox, see <a href="/manual/results-modules.html">How To Select The Modules That Appear On Your Results Page</a>.</p>


<p>We've also open sourced all of the code that powers our <a href="https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT/jobs_api">Federal Jobs Server API</a> in Github.</p>


<h2>Fixes</h2>


<p>And, we've already pushed two bug fixes for the federal Jobs GovBox to production. Searchers no longer see yet-to-be-opened or already closed jobs. </p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How (and When) to Use the Search API]]></title>
    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/api.html"/>
    <updated>2012-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/api.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Search API</p>

<p>We offer our search results as a hosted results page or as an <a href="http://www.howto.gov/mobile/api-basics">application programming interface</a> (API).</p>

<h2>When to Use the Hosted Results</h2>

<p>Most agencies use our hosted search results page. We recommend that you to use our hosted page for the typical use case of returning search results on your website. Using the hosted page has many benefits such as allowing you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Devote minimal development resources for the initial set up.</li>
<li>Benefit from new features automatically as they're rolled out.</li>
<li>Stay current with search best practices, such as type-ahead search and formatting of search results.</li>
</ul>


<h2>When to Use the API</h2>

<p>You may need to access our search results to present them outside of a typical search results page. We offer our results as an API for these use cases.</p>

<p>You can access the API and its documentation at <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Search API.</p>

<p>The API returns results from each of our indexes web, image, document (ODIE), RSS (news), video, best bets (boosted content), and related searches in JSON, JSON-P, or XML.</p>

<p>We recommend you use our API for limited use cases such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Displaying search results within a native mobile application (i.e., an Android or iPhone app).</li>
<li>Integrating USASearch results within existing applications (such as your intranet or publications catalog).</li>
<li>Creating data mashups.</li>
</ul>


<p>Examples of how agencies are currently using the API follow.</p>

<h3>Use Case 1. Display Results in Your Mobile App</h3>

<p>USA.gov and the White House use the Search API to render USASearch results within their mobile apps.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_me79cgQKOE1qid15q.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a USASearch results page in the USA.gov iPhone app" /><br/>

<em>Screenshot of a USASearch results page in the White House iPhone app</em></p>

<p><strong>Related Links for Use Case 1</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://apps.usa.gov/usagov.shtml">USA.gov mobile app</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apps.usa.gov/the-white-house-app.shtml">WhiteHouse mobile app</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/whitehouse">White House Github account</a> (information on and source code for the iOS and Android mobile apps)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Use Case 2. Integrate USASearch Results within existing applications</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.ri.gov">RI.gov</a> manages hundreds of distinct websites. The state provides a consistent search experience across all of its websites. Some sites are centrally controlled by RI.gov. Others are not. Using the Search API, RI.gov programmatically tells USASearch the site's domain from which the user searched (e.g., tmc.dot.ri.gov). RI.gov then highlights results from this specific domain within RI.gov's common look and feel.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows a set of results displayed on Rhode Island's <a href="http://www.tmc.dot.ri.gov/">Transportation Management Center</a> for a search on <em>traffic</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_me7ej38m3P1qid15q.png" alt="Step 1. Searcher on &lt;www.tmc.dot.ri.gov&gt; types traffic in the search box" /><br/>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/go-live.html"/>
    <updated>2012-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/go-live.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your pre-launch checklist will be unique to your agency's workflow, requirements, and deadlines. A typical punch list to go live with USASearch follows.</p>

<h2>Connect Your Site to USASearch</h2>

<p>Most agencies add these two <a href="/manual/get-code.html">snippets of code</a> to the template(s) in their content management systems (rather than adding them to individual pages).</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>1. Does your search box point to USASearch?</strong> Update your search box form code point to USASearch so that, when users execute a search, they'll see your USASearch-hosted results page.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;&lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;&lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt; 
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt; 
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt; 
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt; 
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>2. Do you have the USASearch Javascript tag on your webpages?</strong> This Javascript helps us <a href="/manual/urls.html">find your new and updated pages</a>. It also powers the <a href="/manual/type-ahead.html">type-ahead search</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
     var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };
    var script = document.createElement("script");
    script.type = "text/javascript";
    script.src = "http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
    document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Double Check Your Content Sources</h2>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>3. Have you told us which domain(s) you want to search?</strong> List one or more <a href="/manual/domains.html">domains</a> that you want to search on the first page of web results. Most agencies opt to leave out the 'www' to include all subdomains (e.g., list usa.gov to include answers.usa.gov, blog.usa.gov, publications.usa.gov, etc). Some agencies especially department-level portals opt to also include their bureaus' websites (e.g., Commerce.gov includes commerce.gov, noaa.gov, trade.gov, etc.)</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>4. Have you told us about your RSS feeds?</strong> We love <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>. Tell us about all of your feeds, even if you opt not to show them (see #7 below). They're the quickest way for you to tell us about your new and updated content. Feeds also have well-structured titles, URLs, descriptions, and dates that we use to improve your search results page. (Tip: Preview your feeds from the RSS page in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> to confirm that we've indexed your content.)</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>5. Have you told us about your social media accounts?</strong> Flickr photostreams, tweets, and YouTube videos are a great way to highlight your recent content and to let searchers know about your <a href="/manual/social-media.html">social media</a> channels. Tell us about all of your social media, even if you opt not to show them (see #7 below).</p>

<h2>Customize Your User Interface</h2>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>6. Have you made the search results page look like your website?</strong> Customize the <a href="/manual/look-feel-page.html">look and feel</a> (colors, fonts, favicon) and <a href="/manual/header-footer.html">header and footer</a> of your search results page to create a seamless experience for users as they search and browse your website.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>7. Have you told us what to show on your results page?</strong> Tell us which <a href="/manual/results-modules.html">results modules</a> (i.e., the stuff in the center of the page) and <a href="/manual/sidebar.html">sidebar</a> options (i.e., the navigation in the left-hand column) you want to appear on your search results.</p>

<h2>Set Up Nice-to-Have Features (Optional)</h2>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>8. Have you masked your domain?</strong> We offer <a href="/manual/get-code.html#cname">DNS masking</a>, which allows you to show searchers your search.YOURSITE.gov (instead of search.USA.gov). If you leverage DNS masking you will have to change your search box form action from search.usa.gov to search.YOURSITE.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>9. Have you added the Javascripts for your other third party web services to your results page?</strong> If you have a <a href="/manual/third-party.html">third party service</a> running on your website, you likely want it to run on your results page. Agencies often include their 4Q, AddThis, Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, or WebTrends code, among others.</p>

<h2>Don't Forget SEO (Optional)</h2>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>10. Have you optimized your site so we can find your content?</strong> We follow <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/search/seo">search engine optimization</a> (SEO) best practices. Verify that you have a <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org">robots.txt</a> and an <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org">XML sitemap</a>. These two files are typically located in the root directory of your website (i.e., agency.gov/robots.txt and agency.gov/sitemap.xml, respectively). Also verify that your robots.txt file allows our user agent (usasearch) to access your public content.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdskweoqc81qid15q.png" alt="Check box icon" /> <strong>11. Have you registered your site with the major commercial search engines?</strong> Register for both <a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster">Bing Webmaster Tools</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home">Google Webmaster Tools</a> to maximize the coverage of your content in their search results.</p>

<p>The Trending Queries page in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> reports on the top 10 changing search terms.</p>

<p>You'll see a list of up to 10 terms with the greatest gain between yesterday and today. (Terms must have been searched by at least 10 unique searchers per day to be included in this list.)</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular terms. Create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete.</p>

<p>See the sample report below that shows the 10 trending queries on <a href="http://www.usa.gov/">USA.gov</a> on Monday, November 5, 2012—the day before Election Day.</p>

<p>The Low Click-Thru Rate (CTR) Queries page in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> reports on the top 10 searches with low click-thru rates. It shows the most popular search terms that people generally don't act (click) on.</p>

<p>You'll see a list of up to 10 terms that returned search results, but resulted in a click less than 20 percent of the time over the past day or so. In other words, fewer than one in five people who searched for that topic clicked on a search result. (Terms must have been searched by at least 10 unique searchers per day to be included in this list.)</p>

<p>Use this report to identify issues with coverage. Create a <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bet</a>, add pages that may be missing from the results, or do both to improve recall. Incorporate language from these popular search terms into your titles and descriptions to improve the relevance of results.</p>

<p>Click on any linked word or the <img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mceq7b8LbQ1qid15q.png"/> symbol in the list, and you'll be taken to a Query Timeline chart. There you'll be able to select a period of time for the term, and you can also add a second query for comparison.</p>

<p>Click on the <img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mceqaa2dn41qid15q.png"/> symbol, and you'll be taken to a list of the top clicked URLs for that term.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> This low click-thru report lists only those terms that returned search results. Visit the <a href="/manual/query-logs.html">Query Logs</a> page to see the top queries that returned no results.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Highlighted Feature: Common Search Metrics for the Digital Strategy</em></p>


<p>Do you ever feel like you're drowning in data? Do you feel like finding meaningful insights from the data is like searching for a needle in a haystack? </p>


<p>To standardize and streamline how agencies collect and report this data, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a> requires federal executive branch agencies to implement common performance and customer satisfaction metrics. <a href="http://www.howto.gov">HowTo.gov</a> has published <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/digital-metrics">guidance on common metrics</a>, including describing what you should measure, what to do with the data, and common tools to help you collect and analyze your metrics.</p>


<p>To support you in collecting and reporting your site <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/tagged/analytics">search metrics</a> for the Digital Government Strategy, we've added four new reports to the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home).</p>


<h2>1. Top “no results” queries</h2>


<p>The most popular, valid searches that don't return any results on your site's search results page (e.g., because you don't have the content on your site, or the content isn't findable by the person's search term).<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Review your content to see if you need to add new content, or update existing content to include the words your readers search for. Read our post, <a href="/manual/query-logs.html">How to Analyze Your Query Logs</a>, for more details.</p>


<h2>2. Top searches with low click through rates</h2>


<p>The most popular search terms that people generally don't act (click) on. Consider incorporating language from these popular search terms into page titles or descriptions, to encourage searchers to click on your relevant page. Read our post, <a href="/manual/low-ctr.html">How to Analyze Your Queries with Low Click-Thru Rates</a>, for more details.</p>


<h2>3. Top changing search terms (movement up/down)</h2>


<p>Shows trending topics, what's hot or not. Use this report to investigate why people might be losing interest in once-popular content and consider archiving if it's no longer needed. For newly popular terms, create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete. Read our post, <a href="/manual/trending-queries.html">How to Analyze Your Trending Queries</a>, for more details.</p>


<h2>4. Top clicked URLs for specific queries</h2>


<p>The most common results that searchers found most relevant or appealing, for specific search terms. Review these popular pages and other customer top tasks to make sure they are current, accurate, complete and compelling. Read our post, <a href="/manual/click-stats.html">How to Analyze Your Click Stats</a>, for more details.</p>

<p>The Click Stats page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) reports on the URLs your searchers have clicked on. Data start from October 2012.</p>


<p>You'll see a list, in frequency order, of the most clicked URLs for any time period. You may choose to display 10, 50, 100, 500, or 1,000 results in order of frequency.</p>


<p>See the sample report below that shows the 10 most clicked URLs on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/) in October 2012.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mces5zyKfc1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p>Click on the <img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mceqaa2dn41qid15q.png"/> symbol in the list above, and you'll see the top query terms that led to that URL over the same time period.</p>


<p>See the sample report below that shows the top queries that led to a click on <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov/"><a href="http://www.usajobs.gov/">http://www.usajobs.gov/</a></a> on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/) in October 2012.</p>

<p>See the sample report below that shows the top clicked URLs for <em>jobs</em> on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/) in October 2012.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mceqlwdZnx1qid15q.png"/></p>

    <updated>2012-10-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/releases/2012-10-19.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good news! We completed a major upgrade of our search infrastructure. You likely didn't notice as we completed the upgrade without any downtime for searchers on your site. </p>


<p>Our system is now even more secure, stable, and redundant than it was before. Plus, it is faster, too. Highlights of the upgrade follow.</p>


<p><em><strong>Multihoming</strong></em></p>


<p>We've always had a disaster recovery, backup datacenter, but it often sat idle. We wanted to make better use of all of our servers so we're now leveraging a content delivery network to send traffic to whichever datacenter is geographically closest to the searcher. This allows us to use both datacenters equally and serve our results quickly.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mcd7tbK8RD1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><em><strong>New Hardware</strong></em></p>


<p>We increased our RAM and CPU resources by five times. We have room to grow and to roll out more features.</p>


<p><em><strong>Upgraded Software</strong></em></p>


<p>We're now on Red Hat 6 and Cloudera 4.</p>


<p><em><strong>Speed, Speed, Speed</strong></em></p>


<p>We're always working to improve the speed of our search results. We changed some of our caching rules. We also started to leverage <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> (a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Highlighted Feature: Infinite Scrolling</strong></em></p>


<p>Searchers now have the benefit of infinite scrolling on your results pages. What is infinite scrolling? You've probably used it on many commercial websites, such as <a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=yosemite">Bing Images</a>, <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=yosemite">Duck Duck Go</a>, <a href="http://pinterest.com/search/boards/?q=yosemite">Pinterest</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/yosemite">Twitter</a>. It automatically allows searchers to see more results when they get to the bottom of the page, without clicking on the link for the next page of results.</p>


<p>Try it out on your site's search results page, or on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=yosemite">USA.gov</a>.</p>


<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=yosemite"><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mb2awk8xwU1qid15q.png"/></a></p>


<p>Infinite scrolling has many advantages, including:</p>


<ol><li><em><em>Speed.</em><span> </span></em>The next set of new results loads quicker than a totally new page.</li>
<li><em>Streamlining the user interface.</em> Studies show most searchers don't use the next page buttons. Proactively loading results allows searchers to see more results on one page and to compare them.</li>
<li><em>Simplifying the indexes.</em> When and how we display results from our various web indexes is easier for us, you, and end users. </li>
</ol>


<p><em><strong>Other Features</strong></em></p>


<p>We completely revamped how <a href="/manual/collections.html">collections</a> work to provide you with more flexibility. We encourage you to check out this feature if you're interested in offering  navigation options in the left-hand <a href="/manual/sidebar.html">sidebar</a> on your results page. You can now create a collection:</p>


<ul><li>Covering tens of thousands (or even millions) of web pages.</li>
<li>Covering domains that aren't part of your primary <a href="/manual/domains.html">domain</a> (i.e., that aren't shown on the main web results page). </li>
<li>Without needing to add our Javascript <a href="/manual/get-code.html">code snippet</a>.</li>

<p>We've also published the forms data as a <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/forms.shtml">Federal Forms API</a> for third-party developers.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/releases/2012-07-06.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We hope you had a good Fourth of July!</p>


<p>One of your most frequently asked questions is, "What's your roadmap?" We decided to use the halfway point of the year to expand our release notes to include notes on our upcoming features.</p>


<p><strong>Last Week's New Features</strong></p>


<p>We're now displaying Twitter results in the third rail. Searchers like Twitter results because they often contain your latest information. The third rail increases the  visibility of your tweets and it allows searchers to see both Twitter and YouTube results above the fold in the browser.</p>


<p>See the sample results page below that shows social media results on Commerce.gov for a search on<em> <a href="http://search.commerce.gov/search?query=innovation&amp;affiliate=commerce.gov">innovation</a></em>.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m71vk4FInR1qid15q.jpg"/></p>


<p><strong>Other Features</strong></p>


<ul><li>You may now enter multiple handles if you have more than one social media account for Flickr, Twitter, or YouTube.</li>
<li>Mobile searchers can see image results.</li>
<li>You may now see whether we've indexed your Twitter or Flickr content.</li>
<li>We now index Microsoft Office documents (Excel, Word, and PowerPoint).</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>


<ul><li>We now label Office documents.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue with Flickr indexing.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Coming Up in July</strong></p>


<p>We "celebrated" during the Fourth of July holiday by focusing on some general housekeeping to ensure stability for the rest of the year. We'll release new features to index secure (https) content. We'll also update our USASearch Tag to power both type-ahead and fetching (eliminating the need for you to have put two sets of USASearch javascript on your web pages).</p>


<p><strong>Coming Up Next Quarter</strong></p>


<p>We divide our roadmap into four categories, and we complete one major feature in each category per quarter.</p>


<p><em>1. Customer Services. </em>We plan to improve and facilitate our signup process. We're going to automatically populate more content when you add a site so it is easier for you to take advantage of new features. We also plan to create a dashboard to allow you to see what has changed within your search configuration.</p>


<p><em>2. Content Sources. </em>You've requested more control to divide search results into content sources, topics, etc. We plan to offer more flexibility to allow you to divide your content as it makes sense for your searchers.</p>


<p><em>3. Core Search. </em>One good (or bad) aspect about search is that there is always more work to do in terms of relevancy, speed, scaling, etc. We plan to focus on tuning these aspects, especially for our newer content sources.</p>


<p><em>4. Search Analytics. </em>We have a growing amount of data, and we want to expose more of it to you. In parallel with providing you just a dashboard in the Admin Center, we plan to proactively notify you of any potential issues.</p>


<p>We hope that this glimpse into our recently released features and our short- and long-term roadmap helps you understand what we're working on and what's coming down the road.</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/query-logs.html"/>
    <updated>2012-05-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/query-logs.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Query Logs</p>

<p>The Query Logs page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) reports on the terms and phrases your searchers have input. Data start from the time your agency started using USASearch (but no further back than 2009).</p>


<h2>Specific Search Queries</h2>


<p>You can limit the search for any specific query term or phrase to a specified time period.</p>


<p>See the sample report below that shows the number of times <em>housing</em> (or its stemmed equivalents) was searched on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/) in October 2012.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mcejzpJD7c1qid15q.png"/></p>


<h2>Top Queries</h2>


<p>You can also get a list, in frequency order, of (a) most popular queries and (b) top queries with no results for any time period. You may choose to display 10, 50, 100, 500, or 1,000 results in order of frequency.</p>


<h3>Most Popular Queries</h3>


<p>See the sample report below that shows the 10 most popular queries on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/) on October 15, 2012.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mcekbcO01c1qid15q.png"/></p>


<h3>Top Queries with No Results</h3>


<p>If there are any terms that were searched by 10 unique searchers within the period of a day and returned no results, they'll appear here.</p>


<p>For example, on one agency's website in October 2012, a dozen searches for <em>frostline</em> returned no results. The frost line—also known as depth of frost or freezing—is the depth to which the groundwater in soil is expected to freeze. The agency's pages on the topic referred to this concept as <em>depth of freezing</em>. The agency can use this no results data to help searchers find its content by adding a <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">best bet</a>, updating its existing web pages, or both.</p>


<h2><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mcer6ynAoe1qid15q.png"/> Query Timeline</h2>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Monthly Reports</p>

<p>The Monthly Reports page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) reports on the total number of searches and click throughs. A click through is recorded each time a searcher clicks on a results link. Data start from the time your agency started using USASearch (but no further back than 2009).</p>


<p>Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. Change the time period by selecting a different year or month.</p>


<p>View a detailed report of the number of times searchers have input specific terms and phrases by clicking on the CSV link to download the list as a comma delimited file. The CSV file contains three columns.</p>


<ol><li>Query—The search term or phrase.</li>
<li>Raw count—Total number of times the query was submitted.</li>
<li>IP-deduped—Total number of times the query was submitted by any one IP address. This excludes bots and other traffic that send in a query multiple times from one IP address. It is often a more accurate representation of "real," human traffic.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> </em>On the first of each month, we email you a report with data on the previous month's queries, clicks, and top search terms.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After our migration of Commerce.gov to Drupal, we used the native search tool. However, after looking at the internal site search analytics, it was obvious visitors were not finding what they were looking for. USASearch integrated easily into our system and provided several new features. I appreciate the auto-fill and sort by source features and so do our visitors. Our analytics logs report a much higher percentage of searches resulting in what the visitor was looking for.</p>

DMA Public Web delivers information to a worldwide audience via 500+ official Department of Defense websites such as the official websites for Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force, Marines, Navy, and Army Corps of Engineers. </p>




<p>Our goal is to do that using the latest technologies available in the most cost effective manner possible. Partnering with USASearch has enabled us to further enhance our capabilities while saving upwards of $214,000 per year from our previous enterprise search system.</p>




<p>USASearch has empowered us with more control over search results to more effectively help our customers quickly and easily find the information they are looking for. Their flexible system allows us to make adjustments with ease and quickly deploy search for new sites, two elements that are crucial to the success of our operations. </p>




<p>Beyond that, we feel that USASearch values their stakeholders and we appreciate their flexibility, attention to detail, and migration assistance. They have been in constant contact with our team, and have adjusted their code numerous times to meet our core mission requirements with nothing less than superlative and reliable results. This program is a terrific example of how government agencies are finding new and creative ways to save money while still providing a much needed service.</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/best-bets.html"/>
    <updated>2012-04-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/best-bets.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Best Bets</p>

<p>Want to highlight specific pages or information? Create a Best Bet, which appears above the standard web results when a searcher's query matches the text of its metadata (e.g., title, description, or keywords).</p>


<p>Some uses for Best Bets:</p>


<ul><li>To respond to an emerging—or sudden interest, such as a weather emergency.</li>
<li>To showcase select pages, such as in anticipation of events/holidays or following a site redesign.</li>
<li>To highlight content that is scattered throughout the results pages or doesn't rise to the top of the search results.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are two types of Best Bets.</p>


<h2>Text Best Bets</h2>


<p>Text Best Bets have the same look as a standard web result. They may be individually boosted or boosted in bulk. Up to three relevant best bets are listed under a heading, Recommended by {Site Name}.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m1wph1ENf81qid15q.png"/></p>


<h2>Graphics Best Bets</h2>


<p>Graphics Best Bets have one or two-column layouts and the ability to add an image. Up to one relevant best bet is listed under a heading, {Best Bet Title} by {Site Name}.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m1wpnb62Vs1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p>These headings include a parameter for the site name you provide on the <a href="/manual/site-information.html">Site Information</a> page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home).</p>


<h2>Filling Out the Form to Add Best Bets</h2>


<p><strong><em>Publication Dates.</em> </strong>For both types of Best Bets (text only or graphics), you will have the choice to set a date to publish and a date to deactivate the entry. The default for initial publication is the day in which you input data and create a Best Bet. The default for deactivation is null, so it will stay up forever until you decide to take it down.</p>


<p><strong><em>Adding Keywords.</em> </strong>When adding keywords, remember the title and site description is automatically available to be searched. If you add additional keywords, be sure not to be so general that the site comes up in ways that frustrate the searcher. For example, very general, unqualified words, such as <em>reports</em>, <em>business</em>, or an agency name may be so general that the Best Bet site shows up too frequently. Add specific phrases, as keywords, that are not duplicated in the title and description texts.</p>


<p><strong><em>Images.</em> </strong>For a graphic Best Bet, you may create the feature with or without an image. Be sure to choose only images for which the display rights are not limited. The alt text and the attribution should both be included if you do add an image. The attribution URL links the attribution text to a site of your choice. Sometimes linking to the actual site where the image was found is not appropriate, so you can choose to use or not use this box.</p>


<p><strong><em>Sort and Display.</em></strong> There is no limit as to the number of links that can be included. You can determine what the display order will be of text links within your graphic feature. Use the arrows to rearrange the display order of the links. Remember, you can choose a one or a two column display in the Layout box above. Columns are displayed in newspaper-style format, with an automatic break for columns depending on the number of links listed.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Select the Sidebar Options that Appear on Your Results Page]]></title>
    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/sidebar.html"/>
    <updated>2012-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/sidebar.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Sidebar</p>

<p>Select which navigation options you'd like to appear in the sidebar on your results page. You may choose at any time to activate an option or deactivate it, or to rearrange the order of the options.</p>


<h2>By Format or Topic</h2>


<p>Check the option, Show in Sidebar, to allow searchers to see navigation options in the left-hand column of the results page.</p>


<p>By default, searchers see the options for Everything (i.e., web pages) and Images. To hide Everything or Images, uncheck the option Show in Sidebar. To edit their names, type over the text in the display name fields.</p>


<p><a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds and <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collections</a> that you've provided on their respective pages in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) are listed. By default, these options aren't displayed. To display them, check the option to Show in Sidebar. To edit the name of a feed or collection, click on the hyperlink to update it.</p>


<p>Use the arrows on the left to control the display order.</p>


<p>Determine if you want to include a heading for your navigation options. If you want a heading, type your label in the label field. Keep your label consistent with the options you're listing. If you don't want a heading, leave the label field blank.</p>


<p><em><strong>With Heading. </strong></em>See the sample results page below that shows the navigation options with a heading, labeled Search, displayed on <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> for a search on <em>passport.</em></p>


<p><em><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m1poxc8r0y1qid15q.png"/></em></p>


<p><em><strong>Without Heading. </strong></em>See the sample results page below that shows the navigation options without a heading displayed on <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">WhiteHouse.gov</a> for a search on <em>jobs.</em></p>


<p><em><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m1pp3zFY2d1qid15q.png"/></em></p>


<h2>By Time Period</h2>


<p>By default, searchers may narrow results by time period for any <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds that you've provided on the RSS page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home). If you opt not to show the time period module, <em>all</em> facet options (time period and the other Dublin Core facets discussed below) are hidden.</p>


<p>See the sample results page below that shows the time period options displayed on <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">WhiteHouse.gov</a>. Results for <em>jobs</em> are narrowed to press articles in the last week.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m1ppt9oMt31qid15q.png"/></p>


<h2>By Other Facets</h2>


<p>For any of your <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds that you've extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a> property, searchers may narrow results by the three facets.</p>


<p>Determine if you want to customize the display names for your facets. If you leave the label field blank, we'll display "Contributor," "Publisher," and "Subject" as the default names. Type your desired name in the label field to customize the display name. Keep your label consistent with the options you're listing.</p>

<h2>GovBoxes</h2>


<p>Check the option to Show as a GovBox to allow searchers to see inline, contextually relevant results for selected content sources based on keyword matches with relevant queries.</p>


<h3>1. GovBoxes Built by USASearch</h3>


<p>USASearch currently provides two pre-built GovBoxes.</p>


<ol><li>Agency GovBox—For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-agencies.html">Help Searchers Find Information for Federal Agencies</a>.</li>
<li>MedlinePlus GovBox—For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-health.html">Help Searchers Find Health Information</a>.</li>

<h3>2. Social Media GovBoxes</h3>
<p><a href="/manual/social-media.html">Social media</a> channels that you've provided on the Social Media page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) are listed.</p>
</div>


<h3>3. News GovBox Generated from Your RSS Feeds</h3>


<p><a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds that you've provided on the RSS page in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home) are listed. To edit a feed's name, click on the hyperlink to update it.</p>


<p>All selected feeds will be grouped and displayed in a News GovBox. When a searcher's query matches the title or description of a recent RSS article (i.e., an article from the past year), the article appears in the News GovBox. See the sample results page below that shows a News GovBox displayed on <a href="http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/">BoulderColorado.gov</a> for a search on <em>biking.</em></p>

<h2>Related Modules</h2>


<h3>Related Searches</h3>


<p>Help visitors better define the focus of their search by offering them searches related to their current search term. Suggestions are derived from the searches performed on your website. Up to five searches related to your visitors' original search are displayed and are updated in near real time.</p>


<p>See the sample results page below that shows related searches displayed on <a href="http://access.wa.gov/">Access Washington</a> for a search on <em>seattle. </em></p>


<p><em><img alt="image" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m1crgxGDb61qid15q.png"/></em></p>


<h3>Deep Links</h3>


<p>Deep links provide searchers with direct access to specific subsections of your site. Check the option to display deep links on the first-listed result for relevant search terms.</p>


<p>See the sample results page below that shows deep links displayed on <a href="http://www.noaa.gov">NOAA</a> for a search on <em>hurricanes.</em></p>


<p><em><img alt="image" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m2oogfKJL41qid15q.png"/></em></p>


<h2>Related Sites</h2>


<p>Help visitors find content relevant to their search query that resides on other websites, such as the site for your parent organization or your Spanish-language site. When searchers click on the link to the related site, they see search results for their query on the related site.</p>


<p>Select one of your other USASearch sites from the drop-down menu. Enter the text you'd like searchers to see for the link to the related site. Create two entries, one from the first site to the second and vice versa, if you'd like a reciprocal link.</p>


<p>See the sample results page below that shows a link to GobiernoUSA.gov displayed on USA.gov for a search on <em>cuba.</em></p>


<p><img alt="image" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m2oskqJHiN1qid15q.png"/></p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/page-views.html"/>
    <updated>2012-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

<p>The Page Views page in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> reports on the number of times your search results page is viewed by searchers.</p>

<p>For example, if a searcher is on <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and does a search for <em>cribs</em>, the loading of this results page is recorded as a web page view. From this initial results page the searcher can click around to change the filter from web to images, recalls, FAQs, blog posts, etc. Each time the filter changes, a new page is loaded and it is recorded as a page view.</p>

<p>From these data, you can get answers to questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which type of search do my users use more: web, image, RSS, or collections?</li>
<li>Do my searchers use the time-based filters for RSS feeds?</li>
<li>Which of my document collections is most popular?</li>
<li>Which of my RSS feeds is most popular?</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/header-footer.html"/>
    <updated>2012-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/header-footer.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Select how you'd like to customize your header and footer. The fields that appear on the page will change based on the option you select.</p>


<h2>Option 1. Use a managed header and footer</h2>


<p>Fill out the fields to generate a predefined header and footer.</p>


<p><strong>Color</strong></p>


<p>Customize the color of your header background and text by clicking on the color picker text field. Enter a valid three- or six-digit hex value or pick a color by dragging the cross-hair icon <img alt="crosshair icon" src="http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/jscolor/cross.gif?1332168483"/> inside the color picker window. Drag the triangle icon <img alt="arrow icon" src="http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/jscolor/arrow.gif?1332168483"/> to control the color saturation. When you are done, click anywhere outside the color picker window.</p>


<p><strong>Header URL, text, and image</strong></p>


<p><em><strong>URL.</strong> </em>Provide us with the URL for your website's homepage. We'll use it to provide a link back to you from your header text, image, or both.</p>


<p><em><strong>Text.</strong> </em>Fill out the text you'd like to appear in your header. We've pre-populated this field with your <a href="/manual/site-information.html">site name</a>. Edit the same name, or delete it, if you don't want this text to appear in your header.</p>


<p><em><strong>Image.</strong> </em>Use the Browse&#8230; option to upload the logo or image that you'd like to appear in the header, if any. If you don't have header text, the image will be center-aligned. If you do have header text, the image will be right-aligned. Click on the option, Mark header image for deletion, to delete an uploaded image.</p>


<p><strong>Header and footer navigation</strong></p>


<p>Fill out the titles and URLs if you'd like to add navigation to your header and footer. Use the arrows on the left to rearrange the display order of the links. See the sample results page below that includes navigation.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m1ar9q6nXN1qid15q.png"/></p>


<h2>Option 2. Use CSS and HTML code to create a custom header and footer</h2>


<p>Use this option to more closely replicate the exact header and footer on your website.</p>


<p>In the first box, enter CSS to customize the header and footer of your search results page. We'll run a validation check to ensure your CSS is valid.</p>


<p>In the second box, enter HTML to customize the header of your search results page. In the third box, enter HTML to customize the footer of your search results page. Be sure to enter <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/beginningtutorials/a/aa040502a.htm">absolute hyperlinks</a>, not relative links. </p>


<p>Click on the link, Validate, to check your HTML markup at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu" target="_blank"><a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu">http://validator.w3.org/nu</a></a>. We'll also run a validation check to ensure that no JavaScript is included in your HTML code. We'll also check to ensure no CSS style or link elements are included. To include CSS, specify inline CSS within an opening tag.</p>


<p><strong>Invalid CSS</strong></p>


<p>&lt;html&gt;<br/>&lt;body&gt;<br/>&lt;style&gt; h1 { color: blue } &lt;/style&gt;<br/>&lt;link href=”http://www.yoursite.gov/custom.css” type=”text/css” /&gt;<br/>&lt;/body&gt;<br/>&lt;/html&gt;</p>


<p><strong>Valid CSS</strong></p>


<p>&lt;h1 style="color: blue;"&gt;Your Heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p>


<p><a id="mobile" name="mobile"></a></p>


<h2>Customize your mobile header</h2>


<p>We use device detection to show mobile-friendly search results on mobile phones. (Searchers using tablets and desktop computers see the full, classic header as you set it up above.)</p>


<p><strong>Default mobile header</strong></p>


<p>By default, searchers on mobile phones see the header, <em>YourSiteName Mobile</em>. If you list only one domain on the <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> page, we link your header to this domain. See the sample default mobile header below for <a href="http://www.howto.gov">HowTo.gov</a>.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_meazaml0781qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><strong>Custom mobile header</strong></p>


<p>You can customize your mobile header to include a logo. You can also edit or add your mobile homepage URL.</p>


<p>The logo must be less than 56&#160;KB. We recommend it be no wider than 320 pixels.</p>


<p>You can link to your classic homepage (e.g., <a href="http://www.agency.gov">http://www.agency.gov</a>) or to your specific mobile homepage (e.g., <a href="http://m.agency.gov">http://m.agency.gov</a>). If you use device detection on your website, we recommend that you link to your classic homepage for a more seamless mobile experience. </p>


<p>See the sample custom mobile header below for the <a href="http://m.usa.gov">m.USA.gov</a> results page.</p>


<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_meazs7WsWk1qid15q.png"/></p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/customers/labor.html"/>
    <updated>2012-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/customers/labor.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year the Department of Labor (DOL) participated in the <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/usability/first-fridays">First Fridays</a> Product Testing Program, a “discount” usability testing session designed to find and fix usability problems on <a href="http://www.dol.gov">DOL.gov</a>.</p>


<p>The experience led the DOL web team to <a href="http://social.dol.gov/blog/improving-our-website/">improve DOL.gov</a>, including changing their search engine.</p>


<p>So it was satisfying to learn that they decided to use USASearch to power the search on DOL.gov.  The basis of their decision to select USASearch is exactly what we hope motivates each agency to use USASearch.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The 'out of the box' search results are much more relevant than our prior search results because it harnesses the power of a world-class search engine and the program offers us a great amount of control for suggesting the best links for certain search results and ensuring that new content or breaking news is included in the search results.</p>

<p>Thank you, DOL!</p>

<li><em>Selecting</em> the right technology.</li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Add Your RSS Feeds to Our Index]]></title>
    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/rss.html"/>
    <updated>2012-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/rss.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > RSS</p>

<p>Would you like searchers to be able to search your news content and narrow results by date? Tell us the location and name of your RSS feeds. We will index the content on the feeds so that it appears in your results within minutes.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The U.S. Courts publishes an RSS feed at &lt;www.uscourts.gov/rss/InsideTheJudiciary.rss>.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m0j0q1BUvw1qid15q.png" alt="Inside the Judiciary RSS Feed" /></p>

<p>The U.S. Courts added this RSS feed to their search configuration by using the RSS option in the left-hand menu of the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m4l7qfv91n1qid15q.png" alt="Feed in Admin Center" /></p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Click on the preview option to see the content we have indexed for each feed.</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://search.uscourts.gov/search/news?affiliate=uscourts.gov&amp;amp;channel=76&amp;amp;query=judge">U.S. Courts search results page</a>, searchers can refine their results to see only news results and to narrow by date.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m0j0ufVg8O1qid15q.png" alt="Search results for RSS feed" /></p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Feeds must include a title, link, description, and publication date for each item. We support RSS 2.0 and Atom feeds. Learn more and validate your feeds at:</p>

<ul>
<li>RSS 2.0 <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification">specification</a> and <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/">validator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/">Atom syndication format</a></li>
<li><a href="http://feedvalidator.org">Feed Validator</a> (Atom &amp; RSS)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> We index the content on your RSS feeds from the time you input them in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>. To backfill historical content, temporarily modify your RSS feeds to return more results. Leave this larger feed in place for one hour. You can do this during off-hours and you don't need to coordinate with us.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> When you provide us with your YouTube and Twitter handles on the <a href="/manual/social-media.html">Social Media</a> page in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>, we'll automatically index the RSS feed for your YouTube channel and tweets.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> For any feeds that you've extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a> property, searchers may narrow results by these facets in the <a href="/manual/sidebar.html">sidebar</a> on the results page.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Edit Your Domains]]></title>
    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/domains.html"/>
    <updated>2012-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/domains.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Domains</p>

<p>Enter the applicable domains, subdomains, or folders to return results specific to your website. You do not need to include http:// as we recognize URLs with or without it.</p>

<h2>Entire Site</h2>

<p>List yoursite.gov (without www) to search your entire site, including all subdomains.</p>

<h2>Part of Site</h2>

<ul>
<li>List www.yoursite.gov to include only the primary domain.</li>
<li>List subdomain.yoursite.gov to include subdomains.</li>
<li>List yoursite.gov/folder to include folders.</li>
</ul>


<p>You cannot specify URLs.</p>

<h2>Bulk Upload</h2>

<p>Use the Bulk Upload option to upload a CSV file for portals or other websites with multiple domain configurations.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> You can list folders up to three levels deep (e.g., yoursite.gov/folder1/folder2/folder3). If you want to limit results to folders deeper in your site hierarchy, add our <a href="/manual/get-code.html">USASearch Tag</a> and then use the <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collections</a> option in left-hand menu. E-mail us at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x55;&#83;&#65;&#x53;&#101;&#x61;&#x72;&#x63;&#104;&#64;&#103;&#x73;&#97;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;">&#85;&#83;&#65;&#x53;&#x65;&#x61;&#x72;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#x67;&#115;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;</a> for additional information.</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> You cannot explicitly specify subdomains or folders for exclusion. You can, however, exclude them by omission. For example, to exclude subdomain3, list only subdomain1.yoursite.gov, subdomain2.yoursite.gov, and subdomain4.yoursite.gov.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Create Collections Within Our Index]]></title>
    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/collections.html"/>
    <updated>2012-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/collections.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Collections</p>

<p>Would you like searchers to be able to narrow results to a specific subset of content within your site or on another site?</p>


<p><strong>Step 1. Create a Collection</strong></p>


<p>Create a named collection across any set of domains, subdomains, or subfolders.</p>


<p>Enter a name for the collection (e.g., FAQs).</p>


<p>Enter the URLs that make up this collection. Start each URL prefix with http:// and end it in a trailing slash (/) to avoid unintended matches (e.g., <a href="http://publications.agency.gov/docs/">http://publications.agency.gov/docs/</a> and http://answers.agency.gov/).</p>


<p><img alt="image" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m0j67qCpD31qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><strong>Step 2. Opt to Show in Sidebar</strong></p>


<p>Click on the <a href="/manual/sidebar.html">Sidebar</a> option in the left-hand menu. Check the option, Show in Sidebar, to allow searchers to see navigation options in the left-hand column of the results page.</p>


<p><strong>Step 3. Check Your Search Results Page</strong></p>


<p>Searchers will see an option to narrow their search results to pages in this collection in the left-hand navigation on the results page.</p>


<p><img alt="image" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m0j6jwQoHO1qid15q.png"/></p>


<blockquote>
<div>
<p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> </em>You can set up a search box on your website that limits results to your collection. </p>
<p>Start with the standard form snippet on the <a href="/manual/get-code.html">Get Code</a> page in the Admin Center. Change the form action to action="http://search.usa.gov/search/docs" and add the following line to limit the results to your collection. </p>
<p>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;.</p>
<p>The value is the number for your collection ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your collection in the Admin Center.</p>
<p>See the sample search box below that is limited to news releases in FTC.gov's <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/index.shtml">Newroom</a> for a search on <em>privacy</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mezhnwedQK1qid15q.png"/></p>
<p><em>Newsroom page with a search box that is limited to news </em></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mezhr7VJZU1qid15q.png"/></p>
<p><em>Search results page that returns news results </em><em>only</em></p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/site-information.html"/>
    <updated>2012-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a> > <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Site Information</p>

<h2>Site Name (Required)</h2>

<p>Tell us the name of your website. Searchers see your site name on the results page, such as in the page title or in the best bets. We recommend using the plain language name for your agency or site, e.g. Department of Commerce.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/site-information-name.png" alt="Site name on NIJ.gov's search results page" /></p>

<h2>Site Handle (Required)</h2>

<p>We use your site handle in the HTTP request to specify displaying your customized settings. We recommend making this handle short and unique, e.g. doc or commerce.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/site-information-handle.png" alt="Site handle on NIJ.gov's search results page" /></p>

<h2>Site ID (System Generated)</h2>

<p>We assign a unique numeric ID to your site. We use this ID for some back-end code. You also see this ID in the URL for your site in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<h2>Site Language (Required)</h2>

<p>Choose a language for your site, English or Spanish. We will only index and provide results for pages in your selected language. All display text on the results page will also be in your selected language.</p>

<h2>Emergency Delete</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use this feature to remove a single URL from the results on your site. Use it for emergency reasons only.</li>
<li>It is not meant to fix the results for entire site, such as for launch or redesign problems. For tips on how to fix these problems, view our <a href="/blog/redesign.html">Checklist for a Successful Website Redesign</a>.</li>
<li>Entire the full path of the URL, e.g. use <a href="http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Benefits.shtml">http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Benefits.shtml</a>, not usa.gov/citizen/topics.</li>
<li>Note that a list is created, below the entry box, of all deleted URLs. You can undo the "delete” action in real time at any time.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> If you later need to edit your site handle or switch from one language to the other, e-mail us at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#85;&#x53;&#65;&#83;&#101;&#97;&#x72;&#99;&#104;&#x40;&#x67;&#x73;&#97;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;">&#x55;&#83;&#x41;&#83;&#x65;&#x61;&#x72;&#99;&#x68;&#x40;&#103;&#x73;&#97;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html"/>
    <updated>2011-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago I rolled my first Hadoop system into production. Since then, I've spoken to quite a few people who are eager to try Hadoop themselves in order to solve their own big data problems. Despite having similar backgrounds and data problems, few of these people have sunk their teeth into Hadoop. When I go to Hadoop Meetups in San Francisco, I often meet new people who are evaluating Hadoop and have yet to launch a cluster. Based on my own background and experience, I have some ideas on why this is the case.</p>


<p>I studied computer science in school and have worked on a wide variety of computer systems in my career, with a lot of focus on server-side Java. I learned a bit about building distributed systems and working with large amounts of data when I built a pay-per-click (PPC) ad network in 2004. The system is still in operation and at one point was handling several thousand searches per second. As the sole technical resource on the system, I had to educate myself very quickly about how to scale up.</p>


<p>As I contemplated how doomed I would be should traffic levels increase much more, I remember wondering to myself, "How does Google deal with all that data?" The answer came to me in the form of the Google File System (GFS) paper and later the MapReduce paper, both from Google. It dawned on me that because Google was forced to solve a much larger problem, they had come up with an elegant solution for a whole range of more modest data problems running on commodity hardware. But it wouldn't be until 2010 that I would get to work with this technology firsthand.</p>


<p>As I wrote in an <a href="/blog/adopting-hadoop.html" target="_blank">earlier article</a>, I started re-architecting <a href="http://usasearch.howto.gov">USASearch</a>, the U.S. government's search system, in 2009 based on a solution stack of free, open source software including Ruby on Rails, Solr, and MySQL. A wave of déja vu hit me as I started worrying about what to do with the growing mountain of data piling up in MySQL and our increasing need to analyze it in different ways. I had heard that a new company called Cloudera, founded by some big data people from Yahoo!, Google, and Facebook, was making Hadoop available for the masses in a reliable distribution, much in the same way that RedHat did for Linux. Curiosity got the best of me and I bought the newly minted <em>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</em> from O'Reilly. The most insightful part of the book to me was the very first sentence. It's a quote from Grace Hopper: "In pioneer days, they used oxen for heavy pulling, and when one ox couldn't budge a log, they didn't try to grow a bigger ox." I didn't want to grow a bigger server; I wanted to harness a bunch of small servers together to work in unison. The more I learned the more curious I got, so I started reading more. And that's when I hit my first roadblock.</p>


<p>I think people who have been working with Hadoop technologies for years and years sometimes forget just how rich and diverse the big data software ecosystem has become, and how daunting it can be to folks approaching it for the first time. When people at the Meetups say they are evaluating solutions to their data scaling problem, the answers they hear sound something like this: "Just use Hadoop Hive Pig Mahout Avro HBase Cassandra Oozie Sqoop Flume ZooKeeper Cascading NoSQL RCFile. Oh, almost forgot…cloud."</p>


<p>The thought of wading through all of that just to learn about what I needed to learn about was a bit too overwhelming for me, so I put the whole matter aside for a few months. Over time, I started to dive into each of these projects to understand the primary use case, how active the developer community was and which organizations were using it in production. I converged on the idea of using Hive as a warehouse for our data. I opted for Cloudera's distribution since I wanted to reduce the risk of running into compatibility issues between all the various subsystems. Having tracked down anomalies in a highly multi-threaded and contentious distributed Java system before, I liked the idea of someone else taking on that problem for me.</p>


<p>At some point, I had read everything I could read and grew impatient to get my hands dirty, so I decided to just download CDH3 on my laptop and give it a try. The tutorial instructions for the standalone version worked, and I successfully computed more digits of pi than I ever thought I'd need. After creating some sample data in Hive and running a few queries, I felt pretty confident that Hive would be the right tool for the job. I just needed to find somewhere to install and run HDFS (namenode, secondary namenode, and data nodes), Hadoop (jobtracker and tasktracker nodes), Hive, and Hue for a nice front end to it all.</p>


<p>I knew from my past experience how to stretch the limits of CPU, disk, IO, and memory on commodity servers, and I identified a few potential servers at our primary datacenter with resources I figured I could leverage. Once again I followed the tutorial instructions, this time for the fully distributed version of CDH3, and once again I started to compute pi. And that's when I hit my second roadblock. It took me a few days to figure out that I had a problem with DNS. Each machine needs to be able to resolve every other machine's name and IP in the cluster. Whether you do that via /etc/hosts or a local DNS server is up to you, but it needs to happen or the whole thing gets wedged. Once I got that sorted out, everything just started falling into place and I had Hive working in production within a few days. A week later, I started pulling out the MySQL jobs and deleting big tables, and that's been the trend ever since.</p>


<p>Over time, I've gone on to learn about using custom Ruby mappers in Hive, moving data back and forth between MySQL and Hive with Sqoop, and getting the data into HDFS in real-time with Flume. All of these components from the Cloudera distribution are working nicely in our production environment now, and I sleep well at night knowing I have such a solid, deliberate plan for growth. My initial investment in learning about the Hadoop ecosystem is really paying dividends, but when I think about all those people at the Meetups stuck in evaluation mode, I feel their pain. Does it have to be such a struggle?</p>


<p>The big challenge in my opinion is not that any one piece of the puzzle is too difficult. Any reasonably smart (or in my case stubborn) engineer can set themselves on the task of learning about a new technology once they know that it needs to be learned. The challenge with the Hadoop ecosystem is that it presents the newbie with the meta-problem of figuring out which of these tools are appropriate for their use case at all, and whether or not to even consider the problem today versus deferring it until later. In a way Facebook has it easy, because when you are adding 15TB of data per day, that decision is pretty much made for you.</p>


<p>For all the companies sitting in the twilight between the gigabyte and the petabyte who don't have Hadoop expertise in-house, there is a collection of free information to help guide people to the right solution space (Hadoop Tutorial, White Papers). These days, when I talk to people who are evaluating solutions to their big data problems, my advice to them is to break down their problems into a few discrete use cases and then work on ferreting out the technologies that are designed for that use case. Get a proof of concept to demonstrate that the technology can address your use case and convince yourself and others that you're on the right track. Work toward putting something simple into production. Lather, rinse, and repeat. I am still in that cycle myself, as these days I'm exploring HBase and OpenTSDB to give me low-latency access to time series data and Mahout to do frequent item set mining, but that's another article for another day.</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/type-ahead.html"/>
    <updated>2011-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/type-ahead.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Type-ahead search is fast becoming a best practice on websites, and we've made this technology available for your site. By default, searchers see type-ahead search suggestions on your search results page.</p>


<p>It is a feature that helps your site's visitors construct a search query and navigate more quickly to a search results page.</p>


<p>Suggestions display as a list in a drop-down box. This list forms as the searcher begins to type in the search box. The searcher can stop typing and scan the list presented and click on any term in the drop-down list, or the searcher can resume typing if the choices in the list are not helpful. The queries are listed in order of most popular (i.e., most searched) and not in alphabetical order.</p>


<p><img alt="Type-ahead suggestions for 'hous' on USA.gov" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lwgn3kYff81qid15q.png"/></p>


<p>To implement the Type-ahead Search feature, log in to the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">Admin Center</a>. After logging in, you have choices to make.</p>


<h2>Type-ahead on the Search Results Page</h2>


<p>Enable this feature by checking the box labeled Enable Type-ahead search. You can disable it by unchecking the box later if you want.</p>


<p><em><strong>Populate.</strong></em></p>


<p>Terms and phrases are automatically populated on a regular basis from searches done in your site's search box.</p>


<p>On day one of testing USASearch, there will be no terms in Type-ahead Search (unless you add terms to the list, as noted below). The list of terms will build up over time once you implement USASearch on your live website and searchers type their queries in the search box on your site.</p>


<p><em><strong>Add terms to the list.</strong></em></p>


<p>You may choose to add terms to the list that displays in type-ahead search. You may:</p>


<ol><li>Upload an individual term (i.e. click on "Add a New Entry"), or</li>
<li>Add a group of terms all at once (i.e., click on "Bulk Upload").<br/><br/>To bulk upload:</li>
</ol>


<ul><li>Create a new text file, one entry per line, for example,<br/><br/>acadia national park<br/>okefenokee<br/>okefenokee swamp<br/>yosemite national park<br/>yosemite valley</li>
</ul>


<ul><li>Save as a text file—{filename}.txt—on your computer. (Do <em>not </em>save as spreadsheet or word processing files, such as .xls or .doc.)</li>
<li>Add, modify, or delete individual entries in the file.</li>
<li>Browse for the text file on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the file to the Affiliate Center.</li>
</ul>


<p><em><strong>Delete terms from the list.</strong></em></p>


<p>You may also delete individual terms that you don't want listed, through "Current Entries". Use "Filter" to search for particular terms to edit.</p>


<h2>Type-ahead on Other Web Pages</h2>


<p>You can also add the type-ahead search suggestions to your homepage—or wherever you have a search box on your website—by adding the type-ahead JavaScript code to the head to your HTML web page.</p>


<p>Visit our [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home), select your site, and click on the Get Code option in the left-hand menu. For more details, read our post on <a href="/manual/get-code.html">How to Add Our Code to Your Website</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The USASearch tool is awesome. It makes finding things on our website easier than ever. The results that come back are both quick and relevant. My favorite feature has to be Query Logs. What our users are looking for is now crystal clear, which makes my life way easier. It provides insight into what users want that is sometimes very hard to find. It also allows us to promote the correct content.</p>




<p>For instance, for several months our most search terms were employment and jobs, so we created a Jobs page and put it right on our homepage. After that the search for those terms dropped dramatically, which means users no longer had to poke and search for Jobs/Employment information because it was right where it needed to be.</p>




<p>I almost couldn't believe that this amazing service is free. It's easy to implement and full of useful features, which would normally cost us quite a lot and in this economy it's these types of services that help us save money.</p>

    <link href="http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/adopting-hadoop.html"/>
    <updated>2011-06-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/adopting-hadoop.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>


<p>The United States federal government's <a href="http://search.usa.gov/program" target="_blank">USASearch program</a> provides hosted search services for government affiliate organizations, shares APIs and web services, and operates the government's official search engine at Search.USA.gov. The USASearch <a href="https://search.usa.gov/affiliates/how_it_works" target="_blank">affiliate program</a> offers free search services to any federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government agency. Several hundred websites make use of this service, ranging from the smallest municipality to larger federal sites like <a href="http://weather.gov" target="_blank">weather.gov</a> and <a href="http://usa.gov" target="_blank">usa.gov</a>. The USASearch program leverages the Bing API as the basis for its web results and then augments the user search experience by providing a variety of government-centric information such as related search topics and highlighted editorial content. The entire system is comprised of a suite of open-source tools and resources, including Apache Solr/Lucene, OpenCalais, and Apache Hadoop. Of these, our usage of Hadoop is the most recent. We began using <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop/" target="_blank">Cloudera's Distribution including Apache Hadoop</a> (<a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop" target="_blank">CDH3</a>) for the first time in the Fall, and since then we've seen our usage grow every month— not just in scale, but in scope as well. But before highlighting everything the USASearch program is doing with Hadoop today, I should explain why we began using it in the first place.</p>


<p><strong>Phase 1: Search analytics</strong></p>


<p>All of the search and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/api" target="_blank">API</a> traffic across hundreds of affiliate sites, iPhone apps, and widgets comes through a single search service, and this generates a lot of data. To improve the service, administrators wanted to see aggregated information on what sorts of information searchers were looking for, how well they were finding it, what trends were forming, and so on. Once searches were initiated, they also wanted to know what results were shown and then what results were clicked on. They wanted to see all this information broken down by affiliate over time, and also aggregated across the entire affiliate landscape.</p>


<p>The initial system, like many initial systems, was fairly simple and did just enough to address our most pressing analytics needs. We took the logs from Apache and Ruby on Rails, put them in a big MySQL database on a separate machine, ran nightly and monthly jobs on them, and then exported the summary results to the main database cluster to be served up via a low-latency Rails web interface for analytics. We used a separate physical database machine with lots of memory and disk for the batch processing to keep our production MySQL instances from being impacted by this resource-intensive batch processing.</p>


<p><img alt="Diagram showing the initial dataflow of raw logfiles to analytics apps" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lle73iJ2Ts1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p>As we watched the main database tables grow and the nightly batch jobs take longer and longer, it became clear that we would soon exhaust the resources available on the single database analytics processing node. We looked at scaling up the hardware vertically and sharding the database horizontally, but both options seemed like we were just kicking the can down the road. Larger database hardware would be both costly and eventually insufficient for our needs, and sharding promised to take all the usual issues associated with a single database system (backups, master/slaves, schema management) and multiply them. We wanted the system to be able to grow cost effectively and without downtime, be naturally resilient to failures, and have backups handled sensibly. It was at this point that we started investigating HDFS, Hadoop, and Apache Hive.</p>


<p>HDFS offered us a distributed, resilient, and scalable filesystem while Hadoop promised to bring the work to where the data resided so we could make efficient use of local disk on multiple nodes. Hive, however, really pushed our decision in favor of a Hadoop-based system. Our data is just unstructured enough to make traditional RDBMS schemas a bit brittle and restrictive, but has enough structure to make a schema-less NoSQL system unnecessarily vague. Hive let us compromise between the two— it's sort of a “SomeSQL” system.</p>


<p>But best of all, we could layer the entire Cloudera stack on top of a subset of our existing production machines. By making use of each machine's excess reserve capacity of disk, CPU, and RAM, we were able to get a small proof-of-concept cluster stood up without purchasing any new hardware. The initial results confirmed that our workload lent itself well to distributed processing, as one job went from taking over an hour on a MySQL node to 20 minutes on a three machine Hadoop cluster. Within a week of getting the prototype up and running, we had transitioned all the remaining nightly analytics batch SQL jobs into Hive scripts. The job output fed into a collection of intermediate Hive tables, from which we generated summary data to export to MySQL as low-latency tables for the Rails web interface to use. To prove the scaling point, we spent five minutes adding another datanode/tasktracker to the mix, kicked off the cluster rebalancer, and the whole process ran faster the next day.</p>


<p><img alt="Diagram showing the current dataflow of raw logfiles to analytics apps" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lle73rea1K1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><strong>Phase 2: Feedback loop</strong></p>


<p>The result of all this analysis in Hive shows up not just in various analytics dashboards, but as part of the search experience on many government websites, too. For example, compare the different type-ahead suggestions for ‘<strong>gran</strong>' on <a href="http://nps.gov/">nps.gov</a> and <a>usa.gov</a>. Both sites use the same USASearch backend system, but the suggestions differ completely. We use Hadoop to help us generate contextually relevant and timely search suggestions for hundreds of government sites like this.</p>


<p><img alt="Image showing different type-ahead suggestions on NPS.gov and USA.gov" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lle73ymed31qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><strong>Phase 3: Internal monitoring</strong></p>


<p>Shortly after moving our event stream analysis from MySQL to Hadoop/Hive, we noticed a change in how we thought about data. Freed from the constant anxiety of wondering how we were going to handle an ever-increasing amount of data, we shifted from trying to store only what we really needed to storing whatever we thought might be useful. We first turned our attention to the performance data emitted by the various sub-systems that make up the search program.</p>


<p>Each search results page is potentially made up of many data modules sintered together from calls to the Bing API, our own Solr indexes, a MySQL cluster, and a Redis cache. A small latency problem with any one of them can propagate through the system to create much larger problems, so we want to have a deep knowledge of how each subsystem behaves throughout the day under various circumstances. We were already monitoring the availability of all these services with Opsview, but we had no insight into their performance over time. Whenever we sensed a problem (“Is one of the Solr indexes getting slow?”), we would liberally apply ssh, tail -f, and grep to try to see what was going on. This seemed like a good use case for Hive, so in the case of Solr, for example, we threw the compressed log files into HDFS, wrote a simple SerDe regular expression to define rows in a Hive table partitioned by date, and built a view on top of that for easy manipulation of extracted columns such as the Solr index name and the hour of day. Hive makes it trivially easy to do some fairly sophisticated aggregate analysis on the response times for each Solr index, such as generating a distribution histogram, or calculating the pth percentile.</p>


<p>Some of these Hive queries are not run very often— perhaps just a few times a month— so we don't want to spend time building them into our test-driven Rails analytics framework. On the other hand, they are complex enough that we don't want to rewrite them every time we want to use them. For these cases, we use Beeswax in HUE to save off parameterized queries that can then be shared among engineers or analysts to run on an ad hoc basis.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>


<p>In the space of a few months, we've gone from having a brittle and hard-to-scale RDBMS-based analytics platform to a much more agile Hadoop-based system that was designed to scale intrinsically. We continue to see our Hadoop usage grow in scope with each new data source we add, and it's clear that we'll be relying on it more and more in the future as the suite of tools and resources around Hadoop grows and matures.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the ongoing government effort for transparency, we are going to use our blog to post our release notes on a monthly basis. While they may not be the most exciting posts ever, it seems the logical place to publish our activities. Search, as many know, is difficult with many of the improvements happening behind the scenes.</p>


<p>We divide our work into three categories:</p>


<p>1) Features &#8212; things that you actually notice</p>


<p>2) Bugs &#8212; Fixes to any code issues that may arise </p>


<p>3) Chores &#8212; back-end improvements that you don't notice </p>


<p>We did complete a big chore this month by upgrading to Rails 3 which will be invisible to you, but it will bring additional stability for our search environment and allow us to have longer feature list in the coming months.</p>


<p><strong>New/Enhanced Features:</strong></p>


<ul><li>Searchers see new second-level top navigation on landing pages and SERPs on <a href="http://Search.USA.gov">Search.USA.gov</a> and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/?locale=es">Buscador.USA.gov</a></li>
<li>Spanish searchers see improved <a href="http://search.usa.gov/?locale=es">web</a> and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/images?locale=es&amp;m=false">image</a> landing pages</li>
<li>Spanish searchers see brown color scheme</li>
<li>Visitors sees <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a>-branded search box on all pages</li>
<li>Searchers see updated affiliate and mobile type-ahead search suggestions</li>
<li>Mobile visitors can see SMS option on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/?locale=en&amp;m=true">m.USA.gov</a></li>
<li><span>Searchers see updated affiliate and mobile pages</span><span> </span></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Bugs:</strong></p>


<ul><li>Fixed bugs/display problems with monthly clicks/queries</li>
<li>Inconsistent autocomplete on images landing page and image SERPs</li>
<li>Spanish searchers see updated text on Buscador.USA.gov <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?locale=es&amp;m=false">advanced search page</a></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Chores:</strong></p>


<ul><li>Upgraded to Rails 3 &#8212; the chore list would be long, but let us know if anyone is interested in hearing about the upgrade</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While USASearch is for all levels of government (federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial), most of our customers come from the federal sector. So, we are showcasing a highly-trafficked county site to show how other levels of government successfully leverage our site search service.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.broward.org" target="_blank">Broward County, Florida</a> has a popular web site that serves thousands of multi-lingual users from the Miami metropolitan area. </p>


<p><img alt="Image of the Broward.org homepage" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lloa7zX9zz1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p>We want to thank Rob Nadeau (Web Site Manager for Broward County) for being a good and supportive customer and someone who proactively implements our special features!</p>


<p>Rob offered these kind words about USASearch.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>When USASearch expanded their affiliate program, <a href="http://www.broward.org" target="_blank">Broward County</a> was fortunate to be the first County in the nation to participate in the effort. During times when budgets are limited, the partnership monetarily saved the County by not moving to a commercial search solution. As the program evolved to "new" technology and tools, the County and our visitors once again benefited from an ever-growing feature rich program that now offers a more accurate search with speed 9 times faster.</p>
<ul><li>a customized look and feel</li>
<li>the ability to immediately boost content to showcase specific pages to appear above the main results</li>
<li>type-ahead search suggestions for visitors to our site</li>
<li>the ability to add and remove search suggestions</li>
<li>the ability to generate reports</li>
</ul><p>Thank you for a program that keeps on giving.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Thank you, Rob, and everyone please help us spread the word about USASearch to all levels of government.</p>
