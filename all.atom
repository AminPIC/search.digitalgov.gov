    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I love the new <em>Federal Register</em> feature box that shows me additional results from my search query from the <em>Federal Register</em>. It's like having two searches in one! The "More documents on FederalRegister.gov" link also passes my query directly to the <em>Federal Register</em> API so I can move seamlessly to the FR site to continue my research. This is very helpful.</p></blockquote>

The search experience is close to an external search engine experience, which our customers find familiar and intuitive. We appreciate how much we can custom tailor the DigitalGov Search features for ED's needs, and the detailed, relevant search metrics we can access. All of this helps us improve the search experience, which is so key to how our customers navigate ED.gov.</p></blockquote>

    <updated>2014-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/tos.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following terms of service ("Terms") govern the General Services Administration's (GSA) DigitalGov Search website and services, including the content, documentation, code and related materials, are offered subject to your acceptance of the Terms as well as any relevant sections of the DigitalGov <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/about/policies/">Site Policies</a> (collectively, the "Agreement"). Access to or use of DigitalGov Search services or its content constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>

<ul>
<li>When you use DigitalGov Search, we store information about searches on your site, including: the web page from which searchers accessed your search results, the date and time, the words searched for, items clicked on a page, and the browser and operating system used. We periodically delete our search logs.</li>
<li>We use this information to measure the usage of our website and services and to identify system performance or problem areas. We also use this information to help us develop the service, analyze patterns of usage, and to make the service more useful. This information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. We may anonymize and provide this information to third-party entities for the purposes of analyzing search traffic.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Secondary Use</h3>

<ul>
<li>Customers using our Search Data API cannot cache results.</li>
<li>Data accessed through our website and services does not, and should not, include controls over its end use.</li>
<li>Once the data has been downloaded from DigitalGov Search, we can't vouch for the quality or timeliness of any analyses conducted with data retrieved.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Citing Data</h2>

<p>Customers using the Search Data API must display the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/4/E/04E076D4-60B2-4D31-BCC7-C4805B558DBB/Bing%20product%20guidelines.pdf">Powered by Bing</a> [PDF] logo on 'web' and 'image' search results pages for attribution of these results. Customers using any of the other three indexes ('docs', 'news', and 'videonews') must display "Powered by DigitalGov Search" (using plain text or <a href="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/digitalgov_search_logo.png">our logo</a> for DigitalGov Search) for attribution instead of the Bing logo.</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<h3>Use of Open Source Software</h3>

<p>DigitalGov Search uses open-source software and free or low cost, commercial application programming interfaces when it best meets the needs and mission of GSA.</p>

<h3>Redistribution of Code</h3>

<ol>
<li>Software source code written entirely by GSA staff, and by contractors who are developing software on behalf of GSA, is by default a public domain work.</li>
<li>Software source code previously released under an open source license and then modified by GSA staff is considered a "joint work." It is partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to the terms of the original open-source license.</li>
<li><p>All source code as defined above may be shared with the general public via a highly visible, easily accessible online source code community (such as Github) that facilitates the code's reuse. Source code won't be released if any of the following conditions are met:</p></li>
<li><p>The author of the code determines that the code is too crude to merit distribution or provide value to the broader community.</p></li>
<li>The Government doesn't have the rights to reproduce and release the item. The Government has public release rights when the software is developed by Government personnel, when the Government receives "unlimited rights" in software developed by a contractor at Government expense, or when pre-existing OSS is modified by or for the Government.</li>
<li>The public release of the item is restricted by other law or regulation, such as the Export Administration Regulations or the International Traffic in Arms Regulation.</li>
<li>GSA cybersecurity staff determine that the public release of such code would pose an unacceptable risk to GSA's operational security.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Modification or False Representation of Content</h2>

<p>You may not modify or falsely represent content accessed through DigitalGov Search yet still claim the source is DigitalGov Search.</p>

<h2>Right to Limit</h2>

<p>Users of the website and services must have a valid government email address from a federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government agency. If GSA reasonably believes that you are not a government employee, or a contractor acting within the scope of its government contract, GSA may temporarily or permanently block your use of the website and services.</p>

<p>Use of the APIs may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by GSA. If GSA reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, your ability to use the API may be permanently or temporarily blocked.</p>

<p>GSA may monitor your use of its services to improve the service or to insure compliance with this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Service Termination</h2>

<p>If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by refraining from further use of the website and services. GSA reserves the right (though not the obligation) to (1) refuse to provide the services to you if it is GSA's opinion that use violates any GSA policy, or (2) terminate or deny you access to and use of all or part of the services at any time for any other reason in its sole discretion. Any hosted applications may also be shut down or removed. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>GSA reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement, in whole or in part. Your continued use of or access to the DigitalGov Search services following posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those modified terms. GSA may, in the future, offer new services and/or features. Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

<p>DigitalGov Search services are provided "as is" and on an "as-available" basis. GSA hereby disclaims all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. GSA makes no warranty that the services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.</p>

<h2>Limitations on Liability</h2>

<p>In no event will GSA be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (1) any special, incidental, or consequential damages; (2) the cost of procurement of substitute products or services; or (3) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data.</p>

<h2>General Representations</h2>

<p>You hereby warrant that (1) your use of the website and services will be in strict accordance with the Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations, and (2) your use of the website and services will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between GSA and you concerning the use of the website and services, and may only be modified by the posting of a revised version on this page by GSA.</p>

<h2>Disputes</h2>

<p>Any disputes arising out of this Agreement and access to or use of the services shall be governed by federal law.</p>

<h2>No Waiver of Rights</h2>

<p>GSA's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute waiver of such right or provision.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We often receive questions when an affiliate undergoes a major website upgrade, changes content management systems, or both. We created this checklist to share with you four steps to take to ensure your redesign is successful.</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep the file name and directory structure the same, if possible. If it isn't possible, use 301 redirects to send visitors to the appropriate new pages. For more on 301 redirects, read tips from <a href="http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2011/10/06/managing-redirects-301s-302s-and-canonicals/">Bing</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633">Google</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. Notify other websites that link to you of the changes.</li>
<li>Register for the commercial search engines' webmaster tools.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster">Bing Webmaster Tools</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en">Google Webmaster Tools</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update the <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org">XML sitemap</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> on your website and notify the search engines via the webmaster tools.</li>
<li>Notify the search engines of the content that has been removed via the webmaster tools. Specifically, in Bing, use the <a href="http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2013/03/15/bing-wmt-launches-site-move-tool/">Site Move tool</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you've undergone a redesign, followed these four steps, and you still don't see your content updated in your site search results, please notify us at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#115;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#x2e;&#100;&#105;&#x67;&#105;&#116;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;&#x2e;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;">&#115;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#x68;&#x40;&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#x72;&#x74;&#46;&#x64;&#105;&#x67;&#105;&#116;&#x61;&#108;&#x67;&#111;&#x76;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#x76;</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/brand.html"/>
    <updated>2014-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/brand.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Display</p>

<p>To customize your search results page and match your site's brand:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define your color scheme on the Fonts &amp; Colors page.</li>
<li>Upload your logo on the Image Assets page. (We'll also link your logo to your homepage using the homepage URL you provide on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page.)</li>
<li>Add your navigation links on the Header &amp; Footer page.</li>
</ol>


<p>Read our <a href="/blog/serp-redesign-tips.html">favorite tips</a> to see how other sites have customized their results pages and for some ideas on how to optimize the <a href="/blog/serp-redesign.html">newly redesigned results page</a> for your site.</p>

<h2>Font &amp; Colors</h2>

<p><strong>Font Family.</strong> Leave the default font as-is, or select your preferred font family.</p>

<p><strong>Color Scheme.</strong> Leave the default color scheme as-is, or select Custom to create a customized scheme. Customize the color of any page element by clicking on it and entering a valid three- or six-digit hex value. You can also pick a color by dragging your mouse inside the color picker window.</p>

<h2>Image Assets</h2>

<p><strong>Favicon.</strong> Provide the URL for your agency's favicon. (A <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/favicon/f/blfaqfavicon1.htm">favicon</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, short for favorites icon, is the small image associated with your website.)</p>

<p><strong>Logo.</strong> Use the Choose File option to upload the logo that you'd like to appear in the header of your results page. Click on the option, Mark Logo for Deletion, to delete an uploaded logo. There isn't a required dimension. That said, images less than 550 pixels wide and 100 pixels high tend to work best.</p>

<p>If you don't upload a logo, searchers will simply see the header, <em>Your Site Name</em>. We'll use the site name you provide on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Logo Alignment.</strong> Leave the logo center-aligned, or select the Left option to make it left-aligned.</p>

<p><strong>Logo Alt Text.</strong> Add alt text for your logo. If you don't add custom alt text, we'll use the site name you provide on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page as the default alt text.</p>

<h2>Header &amp; Footer</h2>

<p>Fill out the titles and URLs for the navigation links you'd like to appear in your header and footer. You can add an email address by specifying <em>mailto:</em> within the URL field, such as:</p>

<p>Title: Contact us<br/>
URL: mailto:info@agency.gov</p>

<p>Use the icon with three horizontal lines on the left to change the order.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> As you change each font and color option, the mini search results page in the upper right-hand corner will update to reflect your changes. Once you click save, the changes will appear on your live site.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Our search results page uses a <a href="http://alistapart.com/topic/responsive-design">responsive design</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to ensure it is optimized for searchers anywhere, anytime, and on any device.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> We offer results through our <a href="/manual/api.html">Search Data API</a>, if you'd like to create mash-ups or have complete control of the look and feel of your search results pages. You can access the API by clicking on the Activate Search option in the left-hand menu in the Admin Center.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>Searchers now see <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> facets on the <a href="/blog/serp-redesign.html">newly redesigned search results page</a>.</li>
<li>Searchers now see a consistent look and phrasing for the See more&hellip; option on the various modules on the results page.</li>
<li>You can now toggle the display of <a href="/manual/govbox-federal-register.html"><em>Federal Register</em> results</a> in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</li>
<li>To improve the accessibility of the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>, you now see an outline defining the area of focus, and you can access the links for My Account and Sign Out when navigating with the keyboard.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/downloads/1-3-2/">ElasticSearch 1.3.2</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
<li>We added a notice of upcoming changes to the API Instructions page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed the spacing between titles and descriptions so it is consistent on all of our results pages.</li>
<li>To improve the quality of type-ahead suggestions, we decreased the number of times a term must be searched before appearing as a suggestion.</li>
<li>The option to drill down into detailed data for Best Bets now remains when you change the date on the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page.</li>
<li>Searchers no longer see deleted RSS items with 404 http status codes in their results.</li>
<li>We now pre-validate social media account handles.</li>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/july-2014.html"/>
    <updated>2014-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/july-2014.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Federal Register Documents Are Now Available</h2>

<p>Federal agencies publish notices, proposed rules, and final rules in the <em><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/">Federal Register</a></em>. To make it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in government decision-making, we created the <em>Federal Register</em> GovBox to help searchers find these notices and rules.</p>

<p>This GovBox offers direct access to <em>Federal Register</em> documents. We pull the data from the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/learn/developers">Federal Register API</a> to provide timely information across all documents.</p>

<p>If you <a href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/display-overview.html">opt to show the Federal Register GovBox</a>, searchers looking for topics on your site can readily find the notices and rules that your agency has published in the <em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<p>The full title will be shown within the search results and when <em>Federal Register</em> documents have been posted by multiple agencies, searchers will see both agencies listed.</p>

<p>Documents with open comment periods will appear before relevant documents with closed comment periods. The status of the comment period will be noted in the results. At the bottom of the page, there is a link to see more <em>Federal Register</em> documents.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Our Open Source Strategy]]></title>
    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/open-source.html"/>
    <updated>2014-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/open-source.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We keep an eye on on our what our government counterparts are up to, both in the U.S. and other countries. We first came across <a href="https://www.gov.uk">Gov.UK's</a> philosophy on and approach to <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open">coding in the open</a> a couple of years ago. It caught our attention and we realized we should also articulate our open source strategy.</p>

<h2>Use and Contribute to Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>Since 2010, we've embraced and leveraged open source software to build our site search service for federal, state, and local government websites. This use of open source has allowed us to experience enormous growth over the past few years. In July 2014 alone, over 23 million searchers received results from our service&mdash;a five-fold increase since July 2010.</p>

<p>Our search service is now a complex system made up of many moving parts, including providing type-ahead search suggestions, serving search results, fetching, indexing, and caching content, and providing analytics.</p>

<p>Each of these parts is compiled into our codebase and, as we use open source components for our system, we contribute back to the projects.</p>

<h2>Code in the Open</h2>

<p>We recently began to unravel our monolithic codebase so that we can share individual pieces of our code. To borrow the phrase from Gov.UK, we're now <strong><em>coding in the open</em></strong>.</p>

<p>We recently released the code for our <a href="https://github.com/gsa/oasis">social media image</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">jobs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">recalls</a> API servers. They're our first foray into coding in the open. The source code for these API servers is in <a href="https://github.com/GSA">our GitHub repo</a> and is available for anyone to see and contribute to.</p>

<p>The data products for the jobs and recalls code are also open and available for anyone to consume on our <a href="/developer/index.html">Developer hub</a>.</p>

<p>These three servers and their underlying data now operate outside of our core search codebase.</p>

<p>Following this same model, moving forward, we plan to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Share first&mdash;For every new feature, we'll write the code so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the code, not just us. If the public community contributes to the codebase, we'll be able to improve this feature without taxing our developers.</li>
<li>Expose APIs&mdash;We'll expose our data products as APIs so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the data, not just searchers on a government websites.</li>
<li>Be our own customer&mdash;We'll use our own public code and data just like everyone else. We'll call our own API servers to integrate the data within our search results pages.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Make Things Open to Make Things Better</h2>

<p>We agree with Gov.UK that "to make things open makes things better."</p>

<p>We have finite resources and we don't want to lose our focus on serving our agency customers and improving visitors' search experience on government websites. So, we won't be spending a lot of time to build or support a vibrant community around our code.</p>

<p>That said, we hope that exposing the pieces of our system will be useful to someone somewhere. We'll continue to provide the "ingredients" of our search service so that others will be able to make use of the code and data in ways that we could never imagine.</p>

<h2>And, We're Not Alone</h2>

<p>We're not alone. Other federal agencies have embraced the approach of coding in the open and have <a href="http://gsa.github.io/federal-open-source-repos">GitHub repos</a>. Below are a just a few of our many favorites.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.cfpb.gov">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> has embraced open source, including serving their public data sets through <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/qu">qu</a> and sharing their work at <a href="http://cfpb.github.io">http://cfpb.github.io</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.fda.gov">Food and Drug Administration</a> recently made public FDA datasets more accessible at <a href="https://open.fda.gov">openFDA</a>.</li>
<li>GSA's newly-created <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a> has committed to <a href="http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/93415834296/working-in-public-from-day-1">working in the open from day 1</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> was in the forefront of using open source software in the federal government with their use of Drupal. They're continuing to lead by example by opening up the code for their <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions">We the People petitions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-ios">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-android">Android</a> mobile apps.</li>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/third-party.html"/>
    <updated>2014-08-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/third-party.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Analytics > 3rd Party Tracking</p>

<p>Do you want your search results page to run third-party web services such as 4Q, AddThis, Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, Siteimprove, or WebTrends?</p>

<p>Input the JavaScript code you'd like to call from your search results page. Click submit to send us your request. We'll input your code for you and send you an email to confirm that we've done it.</p>

<p>Some tips for commonly used third-party web services follow.</p>

<h2>Google Analytics Tip</h2>

<p>Within your Google Analytics account, select the option, <em>Do Track Site Search</em>. Set the query parameter as <em>query</em>. For more information, read Google's tip, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012264?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1031951">Set Up and Configure Site Search</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you've requested <a href="/manual/cname.html">domain masking</a> and you want to include the analytics for your <em>search.agency.gov</em> subdomain with your main <em>agency.gov</em> domain, you'll need to set your domain in your Google Analytics JavaScript by including <code>_gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'agency.gov']);</code>.</p>

<p>For more information, read Google's tip, <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite">Tracking Multiple Domains</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>The code you submit should look something like one of the following two scripts.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics Code (Older Format)</h3>

<pre><code> &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 var _gaq = _gaq || []; 
 _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-########-1']); 
 _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

 (function() { 
 var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; 
 ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl'; : 'http://www') +      '.google-analytics.com/ga.js'; 
 var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s); 
 })();
 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Google Analytics Code (Newer Format)</h3>

<pre><code> &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Digital Analytics Program Tip</h2>

<p>Does your federal agency participate in the <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> (DAP)?  You don't need to do anything. We're already fully integrated with DAP.</p>

<h2>ForeSee Tip</h2>

<p>Coordinate with your ForeSee representative and DigitalGov Search to implement your customer satisfaction survey on your results page. The four general steps follow.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Email us at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x73;&#101;&#x61;&#x72;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#x73;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#46;&#x64;&#x69;&#x67;&#x69;&#116;&#97;&#108;&#x67;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;">&#115;&#101;&#x61;&#114;&#99;&#x68;&#x40;&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#x2e;&#100;&#x69;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#x61;&#108;&#103;&#111;&#x76;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;</a> to <a href="/manual/cname.html">set up a CNAME</a> for search.youragency.gov.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the files path in your Foresee code to use an absolute path instead of a relative path.</p>

<p> <strong>Find =></strong> 'files': '/fsrscripts/',</p>

<p> <strong>and replace it with =></strong> 'files': '//www.youragency.gov/fsrscripts/',</p>

<p> <em>(Or, find => 'files': '/foresee/', and replace it with => 'files': '//www.youragency/foresee/',)</em></p>

<p> in the following five files.</p>

<ul>
<li>foresee-trigger.js</li>
<li>foresee-tracker.js</li>
<li>foresee-alive.js</li>
<li>foresee-qualifier.js</li>
<li>foresee-test.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Submit your foresee-trigger.js via our Admin Center. It should look something like the following script. <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.youragency.gov/library/foresee/foresee-trigger.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>We'll send you an email to confirm that we've set up both your CNAME and added the script for your foresee-trigger.js file.</p></li>

<h2>Sidebar (Faceted Navigation)</h2>

<p><strong>Label for Sidebar.</strong> Determine if you want to include a heading for your navigation options. If you want a heading, type your label in the label field. Keep your label short (15 or fewer characters) and consistent with the options you're listing. If you don't want a heading, leave the label field blank.</p>

<ul>
<li>Without heading&mdash;See the sample results page below that shows the navigation options without a heading displayed for a <a href="http://search.whitehouse.gov/search?affiliate=wh&amp;query=jobs">search on <em>jobs</em> on WhiteHouse.gov</a>.</li>
<li>With heading&mdash;See the sample results page below that shows the navigation options with a heading, labeled Search, displayed for a <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=passport">search on <em>passport</em> on USA.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>On/off options for sidebar.</strong> Select which navigation options you'd like to appear in the left-hand sidebar on your results page. Turn an option on to allow searchers to see it. You may choose at any time to turn an option on or off.</p>

<p>You can type over the text in the Name field to edit an option's display name. Keep each name short (15 or fewer characters) and consistent with the content you're searching. Click on the hyperlink in the Source field to update the option's source content. Hover over the icon with three horizontal lines on the left to change the order.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>

<p><strong>On/off options for Modules.</strong> Turn on a module to allow searchers to see inline, contextually relevant results for selected content sources based on keyword matches with relevant queries. There are eight types of modules.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>News.</strong> This option only appears after you've told us about your <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds. When a searcher's query matches the title or description of an RSS article published within the last year, the article appears in the News GovBox. Up to three articles are displayed. Type over the default name, News, in the Name field to edit the display name.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Videos.</strong> This option only appears after you've told us about your <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube</a> channel. When a searcher's query matches the metadata of a video published within the last year, the video appears in the Videos GovBox. Up to four videos are displayed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Job openings.</strong> When a searcher's query matches the text of a job opening published by your agency on USAJobs or NeoGov, the job appears in the Job Openings GovBox. Up to three job openings are displayed. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Help Searchers Find Jobs</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Federal Register</em> documents.</strong> When a searcher's query matches the text of a notice or rule published by your agency in the <em>Federal Register</em>, the document appears in the <em>Federal Register</em> GovBox. Up to three documents are displayed. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-federal-register.html">Help Searchers Find Federal Register Documents</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Related searches.</strong> Help visitors better define the focus of their search by offering them searches related to their current search term. Suggestions are derived from the searches performed on your website. Up to five searches related to your visitors' original search are displayed and are updated in near real time. See, for example, the sample results page below that shows related searches displayed for a <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=accesswashington&amp;query=tacoma">search on <em>tacoma</em> on Access Washington</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health topics.</strong> Help searchers find high-quality, authoritative health information from MedlinePlus and ClinicalTrials.gov. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-health.html">Help Searchers Find Health Information</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recent tweets.</strong> This option only appears after you've told us about your <a href="/manual/twitter.html">Twitter</a> account. When a searcher's query matches the text of a tweet published within the last three months, the tweet appears in the Recent Tweets GovBox. Up to three tweets are displayed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type-ahead search.</strong> Help searchers refine their query by displaying type-ahead search suggestions as a list in the search box. The list forms as a searcher begins to type in the search box. Suggestions are listed in order of most popular (that is, most searched). They're updated every 15 minutes. See, for example, the suggestions as you type di... on <a href="http://search.socialsecurity.gov/search?affiliate=ssa&amp;query=names">SocialSecurity.gov's search results page</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Related Sites</h2>

<p>Help visitors find content relevant to their search query that resides on other websites, such as the site for your parent organization or your Spanish-language site. When searchers click on the link to the related site, they see search results for their query on the related site.</p>

<p>Enter the <a href="/manual/settings.html">site handle</a> for one of your other DigitalGov Search sites. Enter the text you'd like searchers to see for the link to the related site. Create two entries, one from the first site to the second and vice versa, if you'd like a reciprocal link.</p>

<p>See, for example, the Español option displayed on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=venezuela&amp;affiliate=usagov">USA.gov for a search on <em>venezuela</em></a>. When searchers click this option, they see results for <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=venezuela&amp;affiliate=gobiernousa"><em>venezuela</em> on GobiernoUSA.gov</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong>  Searchers may narrow results by time period for any <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds. See, for example, results for a <a href="http://search.whitehouse.gov/search/news?affiliate=wh&amp;channel=6&amp;m=false&amp;query=jobs&amp;tbs=w">search on <em>jobs</em> narrowed to press articles in the last week on WhiteHouse.gov</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong>  For any of your <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds that you've extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> property, searchers may narrow results by the three facets. We'll display "Contributor," "Publisher," and "Subject" as the default names. Email us at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x73;&#101;&#x61;&#x72;&#x63;&#104;&#64;&#x73;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#46;&#100;&#105;&#103;&#x69;&#116;&#97;&#x6c;&#x67;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#118;">&#x73;&#x65;&#x61;&#x72;&#x63;&#104;&#x40;&#x73;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#x74;&#46;&#x64;&#105;&#x67;&#x69;&#116;&#97;&#x6c;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;</a> to if you want to customize these display names.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can also add the type-ahead search suggestions to your homepage, or wherever you have a search box on your website, by adding our <a href="/manual/code.html">JavaScript snippet</a> before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag on your HTML web pages.</p>

<li>Email us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x73;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#104;&#x40;&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#46;&#100;&#x69;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#97;&#108;&#x67;&#111;&#118;&#x2e;&#x67;&#111;&#118;">&#115;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#115;&#x75;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#46;&#x64;&#x69;&#103;&#105;&#x74;&#97;&#x6c;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;</a> and ask us to mask your domain.</li>
<li>Create a CNAME in your external DNS records for <em>search.yoursite.gov</em>. Point it to <em>search.usa.gov.edgekey.net</em>.</li>
<li>When the setup is complete, change the <a href="/manual/code.html">code for your form</a> action from <em>search.usa.gov</em> to <em>search.yoursite.gov</em>.</li>
</ol>


<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Many agencies have both internal and external DNS. Be
sure to update your <em>external</em> DNS records (step 2) before changing your form code (step 3).</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong>  Once the CNAME is set up, if visitors to your site happen to truncate the URL in the browser bar to http://search.yoursite.gov (without any parameters), they're automatically redirected to your homepage at http://www.yoursite.gov.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> By default, we set up search.YOURSITE.gov (such as search.nih.gov). If this subdomain is already used by another application, you can request YOURSITEsearch.YOURSITE.gov (such as usdasearch.usda.gov) or another pattern.</p>

<h2>Tell Us About Your Instagram Account</h2>

<p>Provide us with the <em>username</em> for your Instagram Account.</p>

<p>When you're logged into Instagram, you can see your username at <a href="https://instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=/accounts/edit/">https://instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=/accounts/edit/</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>For example, the Instagram username for the Department of Labor is <a href="http://instagram.com/usdol">usdol</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<h2>Opt to Display Your Instagram Pictures</h2>

<p>When you add the username for your Instagram account, we'll automatically index all of the pictures in your account.</p>

<p>On the image results page, we'll display the pictures from your Instagram account by default. If you'd like to backfill them with the standard image results from your website, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a> and we'll turn on your web images for you.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows image results displayed on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/images?affiliate=u.s.departmentoflabor&amp;query=minimum+wage">DOL.gov for a search on <em>minimum wage</em></a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery? You can index <a href="/manual/rss.html">MRSS feeds</a> so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can also tell us about your <a href="/manual/flickr.html">Flickr</a> photostream. Note that searchers see interspersed results from both Flickr and Instagram. If you have a lot of duplicate images in the two services, consider listing only one in the Admin Center.</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Flickr and Instagram results appear on the <a href="/blog/serp-redesign.html">newly redesigned results page</a> only. Email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#115;&#x65;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#104;&#64;&#x73;&#x75;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#x2e;&#x64;&#x69;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#x61;&#x6c;&#103;&#111;&#x76;&#x2e;&#x67;&#111;&#x76;">&#115;&#101;&#x61;&#x72;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#114;&#116;&#46;&#100;&#x69;&#x67;&#105;&#x74;&#x61;&#x6c;&#103;&#111;&#x76;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#x76;</a> if you're ready to turn on the new results page.</p>

<h2>Tell Us About Your Flickr Photostream</h2>

<p>Provide us with the <em>full URL</em> for your Flickr photostream. Most photostreams are in the photos folder (e.g., <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa">https://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa</a> for HUD). Some photostreams are in the groups folder (such as <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov">https://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov</a> for USA.gov).</p>

<p>The URL must be for your overall photostream. You cannot specify individual photos, sets, favorites, or maps.</p>

<h2>Opt to Display Your Flickr Images</h2>

<p>When you add the URL for your Flickr photostream, we'll automatically index all of the images in your photostream.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Connect Your CMS to Your Search]]></title>
    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/content-integration.html"/>
    <updated>2014-08-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/content-integration.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Content management systems (CMS) have made it easier for us to fetch and index your web site's content directly. Indexing your content directly allows us to improve your site's search by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing real-time access to your new and updated content.</li>
<li>Providing guaranteed, 100% coverage of your content.</li>
<li>Giving searchers the option to sort results by date and to filter results based on your metadata tags.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Give Us Your Content</h2>

<p>The best way for you to give us your content is through either a content API or RSS feed. It doesn't matter what underlying technology you use to publish your content as long as you can provide us with the following four fields.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Title.</strong> The page's title.</li>
<li><strong>Description.</strong> The page's full text in the description for a full text search. Or, provide a short snippet about the page for a more precise search.</li>
<li><strong>URL.</strong> The page's URL.</li>
<li><strong>Date.</strong> The page's publication or revision date. Provide whichever date you'd like searchers to see.</li>
</ol>


<p>We also support custom fields. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Let us know</a> if you have any custom fields that you'd like us to index.</p>

<h3>Via Content APIs</h3>

<p>What is a content API? It is an application programming interface (API) to your website's content. It is output directly from your site's CMS. Content APIs are relatively easy to create from CMS such as Drupal or WordPress.</p>

<p>If you already have a content API, email us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x73;&#101;&#x61;&#114;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x64;&#x69;&#x67;&#x69;&#x74;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;&#x2e;&#103;&#111;&#x76;">&#115;&#x65;&#x61;&#114;&#99;&#x68;&#64;&#x73;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#46;&#x64;&#105;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#x61;&#108;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;</a> so we can get you up and running.</p>

<p>If you don't have one yet, below are a few good references to get you started.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Drupal APIs.</strong> The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/services_entity">Services Entity</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/contentapi">Content API</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> modules both create content APIs from Drupal.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress APIs.</strong> The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/">JSON API</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API">WordPress API</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> plugins both create content APIs from WordPress.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Via RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>RSS is a standard for content syndication. RSS is used to notify others about new content on your site. We use it to index your content.</p>

<p>If you don't already have an RSS feed, below are a few good references to get you started.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Drupal Feeds.</strong> Drupal includes built-in RSS feed administration out-of-the-box. No modules are required. In Drupal 7, you can find it Admin > Config > Services > RSS. Plugins, such as <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/feeds">Feeds</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, allow you to extend the out-of-the-box RSS feed capability. You can use views, such as <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views_rss">Views RSS</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, to turn a customized view into an RSS feed.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress Feeds.</strong> WordPress creates various RSS feeds out-of-the-box. Learn how to set up <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds">WordPress feeds</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_Feeds">customize feeds</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Most RSS feeds show the latest 10 items by default. This means that you'll need to create a one-time "baseline" feed to give us <em>all</em> of your existing content. Email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x73;&#x65;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#104;&#64;&#x73;&#x75;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#46;&#100;&#105;&#x67;&#x69;&#x74;&#x61;&#108;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;&#x2e;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;">&#x73;&#101;&#x61;&#114;&#x63;&#104;&#x40;&#x73;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#46;&#100;&#105;&#x67;&#105;&#x74;&#97;&#x6c;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;</a> so we can coordinate the indexing of your baseline feed with you. After we've indexed your existing content, we'll use the 10 items in your standard RSS feed to index your new and updated content.</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>

<p>DigitalGov Search (formerly USASearch) got its start when Internet entrepreneur Eric Brewer, whose early research was funded by the Department of Defense, offered to donate a powerful search engine to government. That gift helped accelerate the government's earlier work to create a government-wide portal.</p>

<p>In June 2000, President Clinton announced the gift from the Federal Search Foundation, a nonprofit organization established by Brewer, and instructed that an official U.S. web portal be launched within 90 days. USA.gov went online on September 22, 2000 under the name FirstGov.gov with a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001109105200/http://www.firstgov.gov">prominent search box</a> to allow the public to search across government websites.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/content-overview.html"/>
    <updated>2014-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/content-overview.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > Content Overview</p>

<p>To display the results on your search results page, we index content from various sources. Each time a searcher does a query on your site, we determine which index best answers the searcher’s question and display results from it. This means a single search results page is often comprised of several indexes.</p>

<p>You need to add your content to each of our indexes, if you’d like results from that index to appear.</p>

<h2>Add Your Web Pages</h2>

<p>You can add your web pages in one or more of the following three ways.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Give Us Your Structured Content.</strong> We can <em>fetch</em> and index your all of web site’s content directly. The most common way for you to <a href="/blog/content-integration.html">give us your content is through a full-text content API or RSS feed</a>. This option provides you with the most accurate and timely results.</li>
<li><strong>Bring Your Own Index.</strong> We can leverage almost any search index directly. When you opt to you <a href="/blog/byoi.html">bring your own index</a>, we'll send a searcher's query to the search index you’ve provided and we'll render the results within our search results page. This option allows you to choose the index that best meets your needs.</li>
<li><strong>Use the Default Commercial Results.</strong> When you <a href="/manual/domains.html">fill out your domains</a>, we’ll show results for all of your web pages listed within these domains. We don’t <em>crawl</em> so, by default, these web results are powered by Bing or Google. This option is most useful for portals or other sites that search across many (sub)domains that are outside of your direct publishing control.</li>
</ol>


<p>Once you've added your web pages, you can create <a href="/manual/collections.html">collections</a> to give searchers the option to narrow (or, less frequently, broaden) the results to a specific subset of pages.</p>

<h2>Add Your Images</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flickr.</strong> When you <a href="/manual/flickr.html">fill out your Flickr URL</a>, we’ll index your Flickr photostream.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram.</strong> When you <a href="/manual/instagram.html">fill out your Instagram account</a>, we’ll index your Instagram photos.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Galleries on Your Site.</strong> Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's images? When you <a href="/manual/rss.html">provide us with a media RSS</a> (MRSS) for your gallery, we’ll index its images.</li>
<li><strong>Images on Your Web Pages.</strong> If your Flickr, Instagram, and photo galleries are sparse, you can <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a> to request that we backfill these image results with the images published on the web pages of the <a href="/manual/domains.html">domain you’ve filled out</a>. Note that these images tend to be lower quality than those in your social media accounts or curated galleries, which is why they’re not turned on by default.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Add Your Videos</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>YouTube.</strong> When you <a href="/manual/youtube.html">fill out your YouTube account</a>, we’ll index your YouTube videos.</li>
<li><strong>Video Galleries on Your Site.</strong> Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's videos? When you <a href="/manual/rss.html">provide us with a media RSS</a> (MRSS) for your gallery, we’ll index its videos.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Add Your News</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>RSS Feeds.</strong> Do you have RSS feeds set up for your press releases, blog posts, or other newsworthy content? When you <a href="/manual/rss.html">provide us with an RSS</a>, we’ll index the news items on that feed.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter.</strong> Do you use Twitter to communicate about your agency’s newsworthy content? When you <a href="/manual/twitter.html">fill out your Twitter account</a>, we’ll index your tweets.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Add Your Recommendations</h2>

<p>Create best bets (<a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">text</a> or <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">graphics</a>) to promote specific web pages. Best bets appear above the standard web results when a searcher's query matches the text of their titles, descriptions, or keywords.</p>

<h2>Turn It All On</h2>

<p>After you've added your content, be sure to <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">set the display options</a> to control how each index appears on your search results page.</p>

<p>We also have three pre-built, government-centric content modules that you can opt to turn on, too.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Job Openings.</strong> <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Toggle on the Jobs module</a> to show your agency’s job openings from USAJobs (federal government) or NeoGov (applicable local and state governments).</li>
<li><strong><em>Federal Register</em> Documents.</strong> <a href="/manual/govbox-federal-register.html">Toggle on the <em>Federal Register</em> module</a> to show your agency’s documents posted on FederalRegister.gov.</li>
<li><strong>Health Topics.</strong> <a href="/manual/govbox-health.html">Toggle on the Health Topics module</a> to show authoritative health information from MedlinePlus and ClinicalTrials.gov.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> We’ve connected your site to your agency on the backend. If you’re not seeing jobs or <em>Federal Register</em> documents specific to your agency, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a> so we can fix the agency setting for your site.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/best-bets-text.html"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > Best Bets: Text</p>

<p>Do you want to promote a specific web page? Create a Text Best Bet.</p>

<p>A best bet appears above the standard web results when a searcher's query matches the text of its title, description, or keywords.</p>

<p>Text best bets have the same look as standard web results. Up to three relevant best bets are listed under a heading, Recommended by YourSite.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows a text best bet displayed on TSA.gov for a search on <em><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=razors&amp;affiliate=tsa.gov">razors</a></em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/best-bets-text.png" alt="Text best bets for 'razors' on TSA.gov" /></p>

<p>Text best bets may be added individually or via bulk upload.</p>

<h2>Add an Individual Text Best Bet</h2>

<p><strong><em>URL.</em></strong> Add the URL of the web page that you want to promote.</p>

<p><strong><em>Title and Description.</em></strong> Add the title and description of the web page that you want to promote. Each field can have up to 255 characters. Titles and descriptions are visible to searchers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Status and Publish Dates.</em></strong> The default start date is the day on which you create the best bet. The default end date is null, so it will stay up forever until you decide to take it down. You can opt to set a start and end date to control to specify other start and end dates. You can also opt to set its status as either active or inactive.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keywords.</em></strong> Keywords are optional and they're <em>not</em> visible to searchers. Add specific words or phrases that aren't already included in the visible title or description. Common keywords include synonyms, acronyms, compound words, misspellings, slang, or other variants. Enter each keyword (word or phrase up to 255 characters) in a separate field.</p>

<h2>Add Multiple Best Bets via Bulk Upload</h2>

<p>Create a comma-separated file with the following fields (in this order). Download our <a href="/files/best-bets-template.csv">sample template for uploading best bets</a> [CSV] to see the correct format.</p>

<p>Title, URL, Description, StartDate, EndDate, Keywords</p>

<p>Title, URL, and description are required. Start date, end date, and keywords are optional. Save the file with .csv, .txt, or .xml extension and upload it.</p>

<p>Bulk upload updates any existing, matching entries and appends new entries to them.</p>

<h2>When Searchers See Your Best Bets</h2>

<p>Searchers see your best bets when their query:</p>

<ul>
<li>Matches any or all words in the title,</li>
<li>Matches any of all words in the description, or</li>
<li>Matches a keyword exactly.</li>
</ul>


<p>Matches are made within, but not across, fields.</p>

<p>A sample best bet entry is below.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Estate Tax<br/>
<strong>Description:</strong> A tax on your right to transfer property after you pass away.<br/>
<strong>Keyword 1:</strong> death tax<br/>
<strong>Keyword 2:</strong> inheritance tax<br/>
<strong>Keyword 3:</strong> fair market value<br/>
<strong>Keyword 4:</strong> market value</p>

<p>This best bet would display for searches on estate tax (exact title match), estate (partial title match), tax on the estate (title match that includes stopwords), estate taxes (title match for singular/plural variant), property tax (partial description match), propertey tax (description match with a slight misspelling), and death tax (exact keyword match), among other queries.</p>

<p>It would <em>not</em> display for searches on death, death property, taxes after death, fair value, or estate property tax as they're only partial keyword or cross field matches.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> See also our closely related feature that allows you to create a <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">Graphics Best Best</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Analyze the number of impressions and clicks and clickthru rate for each best bet on the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page. Use the data to inform your titles, descriptions, and keywords and your decision to deactivate or delete an entry.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Use the color coding in the table on this page to see a best bet's status. Entries with green background shading are active. They're shown to searchers on your site. Entries with yellow background shading aren't shown to searchers because they're inactive, expired (by the publish end date), or both.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/byoi.html"/>
    <updated>2014-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/byoi.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>About the Pilot</h2>

<p>Each year we ask you for feedback about DigitalGov Search and other programs in GSA's <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729">Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies</a>. Many of you respond to our customer experience surveys.</p>

<p>We consistently hear that, in these times of tight budgets, you value our service being free. We also hear you loud and clear when you tell us that you'd like to choose which search results you use&mdash;from Bing, Google, or some other source.</p>

<p>Based on your feedback, we now <a href="/blog/content-integration.html">index your content directly from RSS feeds or content APIs</a>.</p>

<p>We also allow you to bring your own index (BYOI). This helps us make sure we continue to provide you the best, most cost-effective service possible and gives you the choice you want.</p>

<h2>How to Participate</h2>

<p>Since this is still a pilot, the setup is manual. Email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#x65;&#97;&#x72;&#99;&#x68;&#64;&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x2e;&#x64;&#105;&#x67;&#105;&#116;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;">&#x73;&#x65;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x2e;&#x64;&#x69;&#103;&#105;&#x74;&#97;&#108;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;</a> to let us know you're interested in participating in the pilot.</p>

<p>We can leverage almost any search index directly. For each web search, we'll send a searcher's query to your chosen search index, and we'll render the results within our search results page.</p>

<h3>Google Search Appliance</h3>

<p>If you already have (or plan to purchase), a Google Search Appliance, we can accept the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/static/gsa/docs/admin/70/gsa_doc_set/xml_reference/results_format.html#1078410">XML output</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> from your appliance. You'll be responsible for managing the number of documents indexed as this affects the cost of the appliance (such as $x for up to x documents).</p>

<p>See GSAAdvantage for options to <a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/search.do?q=0:2google+search+appliance">purchase a Google Search Appliance</a>.</p>

<h3>Google Site Search</h3>

<p>If you already have (or plan to purchase), Google Site Search, we can accept your <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview">API key</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. You'll be responsible for managing traffic levels as this affects the cost (such as $x per 1,000 queries).</p>

<p>See GSAAdvantage for options to <a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/search.do?q=0:2google+site+search">purchase Google Site Search</a>.</p>

<p>All of the analytics in the Admin Center are updated in real-time, which means that you  instantaneously see the searches and clicks that are performed on your site.</p>

<p>You see filtered data by default. You can toggle between a filtered or unfiltered view.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filtered.</strong> Several rules are applied to remove bot and other non-human looking traffic. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site's visitors.</li>
<li><strong>Unfiltered.</strong> Nearly all searches and clicks are included. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded. Some of you may see dramatically more data in the unfiltered view.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> The option to view (un)filtered data is a per-user, "sticky" setting. It applies to you only (not any other users on your agency's account). It applies across all of your sites (not just the site you're currently viewing).</p>

    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/june-2014.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>Feature 1. We incorporated your feedback into our redesigned results page.</h3>

<p>We're continuing to work on our redesigned search results page to incorporate your feedback. Searchers now see a more prominent option to browse your site.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=federalstudentaid"><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/release-06-2014-fedaid-browse.png" title="Redesigned option to browse site" alt="Redesigned option to browse site" /></a></p>

<p>Additionally, you can now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Left align your logo;</li>
<li>Add a direct link to your advanced search page (using the syntax http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?affiliate=<a href="/manual/settings.html">YourSiteHandle</a>); and</li>
<li>Display images from <a href="/manual/rss.html">media RSS feeds</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>All job openings (beyond those for U.S. citizens only) now appear when searchers click on the link to see all the openings on <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/">USAJobs</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=jobs"><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/release-06-2014-USAgov.png" title="Tweaks to the redesigned USA.gov  results page" alt="Tweaks to the redesigned USA.gov results page" /></a></p>

<h3>Feature 2. You can access real-time, unfiltered analytics.</h3>

<p>We recently upgraded our underlying analytics framework to use the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/">ELK stack</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. We've gained many benefits with the upgrade. There are also two big benefits for you.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit #1: Real-time Data.</strong> You can now instantaneously see the searches and clicks that are performed on your site. We previously processed some of your analytics via nightly cron jobs so there was a delay before you saw the data. Try it out. Do a search on your site and then go to <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>. You'll see your search query on the dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit #2: Unfiltered Data.</strong> You can now access your unfiltered analytics via the Admin Center so you can more easily manipulate the data. We previously only provided unfiltered data in the CSV downloads or via secure FTP.</p>

<p>You still see filtered data by default. You can toggle between a filtered or unfiltered view by going to the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > Analytics > Settings.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Filtered.</em> Several rules are applied to remove bot and other non-human looking traffic. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site's visitors.</li>
<li><em>Unfiltered.</em> Nearly all searches and clicks are included. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded. Some of you may see dramatically more data in the unfiltered view.</li>
</ul>

<p>Would you like searchers to be able to narrow results to a specific subset of content within your site or on another site? You can create a collection across any set of domains, subdomains, or subfolders.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Create a Collection</h2>

<p>Enter a name for the collection (such as FAQs, Archive, or News).</p>

<p>Enter the URLs for the domains, subdomains, or subfolders that make up this collection. Start each URL prefix with http:// and end it in a trailing slash () to avoid unintended matches (e.g., http://publications.agency.gov/docs/ and http://answers.agency.gov).</p>

<p>You cannot specify URLs for individual web pages.</p>

<h2>Step 2. Opt to Show in Sidebar</h2>

<p>Click on the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. Turn on your collection to allow searchers to see it as a navigation option above the search box on the results page.</p>

<h2>Step 3. Check Your Search Results Page</h2>

<p>Searchers will see an option to narrow their search results to pages in this collection above the search box on the results page.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/manual-collection-2.png" alt="Collection on the search results page" /></p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can set up a search box on your website that limits results to your collection.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with the standard form snippet on the <a href="/manual/code.html">Code Snippets</a> page under the Activate Search tab.</li>
<li>Change the form action from <code>action="http://search.usa.gov/search/"</code> to <code>action="http://search.usa.gov/search/docs"</code>.</li>
<li>Add the following line to limit the results to your collection: <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>The value is the number for your collection ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your collection in the Admin Center.</p>

<p>See the sample search box below that is limited to news on <a href="http://search.nih.gov/search/docs?affiliate=nih&amp;dc=565&amp;query=autism">NIH.gov for a search on <em>autism</em></a>.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/best-bets-graphics.html"/>
    <updated>2014-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/best-bets-graphics.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > Best Bets: Graphics</p>

<p>Do you want to promote a specific web page or collection of web pages? Create a Graphics Best Bet.</p>

<p>A best bet appears above the standard web results when a searcher's query matches the text of its title, description, or keywords.</p>

<p>Graphics best bets have a one or two-column layout and you can add an image. The most relevant best bet is listed under a heading, {Best Bet Title} by {<a href="/manual/settings.html">Site Name</a>}.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows a text best bet displayed on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usgs&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=tsunamis">USGS.gov for a search on tsunamis</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usgs&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=tsunamis"><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/best-bets-graphics.png" title="Graphics best bet highlighting tsunami links on USGS.gov" alt="Graphics best bet highlighting tsunami links on USGS.gov" /></a></p>

<p>There are a variety of layouts possible for graphics best bets.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>One column with a collection of links and an image</strong> displayed on USA.gov for a search on <em><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=wildfires&amp;affiliate=usa.gov">wildfires</a></em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>One column with a link to a specific web page and an image</strong> displayed on WhiteHouse.gov for a search on <em><a href="http://search.whitehouse.gov/search?affiliate=wh&amp;query=jobs">jobs</a></em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Two columns with a collection of links only</strong> displayed on USA.gov for a search on <em><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=holidays&amp;affiliate=usa.gov">holidays</a></em>.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Add a Graphics Best Bet</h2>

<p><strong><em>Title.</em></strong> Add the title (up to 255 characters) of the web page or collection of web pages that you want to promote. The title is visible to searchers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Title URL.</em></strong> Add the URL of the primary web page that you want to promote. This field is optional.</p>

<p><strong><em>Status and Publish Dates.</em></strong> The default start date is the day on which you create the best bet. The default end date is null, so it will stay up forever until you decide to take it down. You can opt to set a start and end date to control to specify other start and end dates. You can also opt to set its status as either active or inactive.</p>

<p><strong><em>Layout.</em></strong> Select a one- or two-column layout.</p>

<p><strong><em>Image.</em></strong> You can opt to add an image.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keywords.</em></strong> Keywords are optional and they're <em>not</em> visible to searchers. Add specific words or phrases that aren't already included in the visible title or link titles. Common keywords include synonyms, acronyms, compound words, misspellings, slang, or other variants. Enter each keyword (word or phrase up to 255 characters) in a separate field.</p>

<p><strong><em>Links.</em></strong> Enter a title and URL for each link. There is no limit on the number of links. Use the three horizontal bars on the left to rearrange the display order of the links. If you select a two-column layout above, links are displayed in newspaper-style format, with an automatic break for columns depending on how many links you list. The link titles are visible to searchers.</p>

<h2>When Searchers See Your Best Bets</h2>

<p>Searchers see your best bets when their query:</p>

<ul>
<li>Matches any or all words in the title,</li>
<li>Matches any of all words in the link titles, or</li>
<li>Matches a keyword exactly.</li>
</ul>


<p>Matches are made within, but not across, fields.</p>

<p>A sample best bet entry is below.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Estate Tax<br/>
<strong>Link title 1:</strong> Transfer Property After You Pass Away<br/>
<strong>Link title 2:</strong> Estate Tax Rights<br/>
<strong>Link title 3:</strong> Tax Rates<br/>
<strong>Keyword 1:</strong> death tax<br/>
<strong>Keyword 2:</strong> inheritance tax<br/>
<strong>Keyword 3:</strong> fair market value<br/>
<strong>Keyword 4:</strong> market value</p>

<p>This best bet would display for searches on estate tax (exact title match), estate (partial title match), tax on the estate (title match that includes stopwords), estate taxes (title match for singular/plural variant), property tax (partial link title match), propertey tax (link title match with a slight misspelling), and death tax (exact keyword match), among other queries.</p>

<p>It would <em>not</em> display for searches on death, death property, taxes after death, fair value, or estate property tax as they're only partial keyword or cross field matches.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> See also our closely related feature that allows you to create a <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Text Best Best</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Analyze the number of impressions and clicks and clickthru rate for each best bet on the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page. Use the data to inform your titles, descriptions, and keywords and your decision to deactivate or delete an entry.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Use the color coding in the table on this page to see a best bet's status. Entries with green background shading are active. They're shown to searchers on your site. Entries with yellow background shading aren't shown to searchers because they're inactive, expired (by the publish end date), or both.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How (and When) to Use the Search API]]></title>
    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/api.html"/>
    <updated>2014-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/api.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Activate Search > API Instructions</p>

<p>We offer our search results as a hosted results page (using our <a href="/manual/code.html">code snippets</a>) or as an <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/category/code/api/">application programming interface</a> (API).</p>

<h2>When to Use the Hosted Results</h2>

<p>Most agencies use our hosted search results page. We recommend that you to use our hosted page for the typical use case of returning search results on your website. Using the hosted page has many benefits such as allowing you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Devote minimal development resources for the initial set up.</li>
<li>Benefit from new features automatically as they're rolled out.</li>
<li>Stay current with search best practices, such as type-ahead search and formatting of search results.</li>
</ul>


<h2>When to Use the API</h2>

<p>You may need to access our search results to present them outside of a typical search results page. We offer our results as an API for these use cases.</p>

<p>You can access the API and its documentation at <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Activate Search > API Instructions.</p>

<p>The API returns results from each of our indexes&mdash;web, image, document (ODIE), RSS (news), video, best bets (boosted content), related searches, and <a href="/developer/jobs.html">jobs</a>&mdash;in JSON, JSON-P, or XML.</p>

<p>We recommend you use our API for limited use cases such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Displaying search results within a native mobile application (i.e., an Android or iPhone app).</li>
<li>Integrating DigitalGov Search results within existing applications (such as your intranet or publications catalog).</li>
<li>Creating data mashups.</li>
</ul>


<p>Examples of how agencies are currently using the API follow.</p>

<h3>Use Case 1. Display Results in Your Mobile App</h3>

<p>The White House uses the Search API to render DigitalGov Search results within their mobile apps.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_me78zp7y4v1qid15q.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a DigitalGov Search results page in the White House iPhone app" /><br/>
<em>Screenshot of a DigitalGov Search results page in the White House iPhone app</em></p>

<p><strong>Related Links for Use Case 1</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://apps.usa.gov/the-white-house-app.shtml">WhiteHouse mobile app</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/whitehouse">White House Github account</a> (information on and source code for the iOS and Android mobile apps)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Use Case 2. Integrate DigitalGov Search results within existing applications</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.ri.gov">RI.gov</a> manages hundreds of distinct websites. The state provides a consistent search experience across all of its websites. Some sites are centrally controlled by RI.gov. Others are not. Using the Search API, RI.gov programmatically tells us the site's domain from which the user searched (e.g., tmc.dot.ri.gov). RI.gov then highlights results from this specific domain within RI.gov's common look and feel.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows a set of results displayed on Rhode Island's <a href="http://www.tmc.dot.ri.gov">Transportation Management Center</a> for a search on <em>traffic</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_me7ej38m3P1qid15q.png" alt="Step 1. Searcher on &lt;www.tmc.dot.ri.gov&gt; types traffic in the search box" /><br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Features</h2>

<p>We officially rolled our newly <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/serp-redesign.html">redesigned results page</a>.</p>

<p>As we continue to add features to our search results page, you can see small, incremental changes. We added a thin, visible border around the search box to improve its visibility, especially against a white background. We changed the color of the query term in the search box from gray to black. We also added more padding around <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bets</a> so that searchers can more readily distinguish them from web results. At the bottom of page, we added "Page 1" to "Next >>" to more clearly indicate that more results are available.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=huricane"><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/release-05-2014-usa-huricane.png" title="Tweaks to the redesigned USA.gov results page" alt="Tweaks to the redesigned USA.gov results page" /></a></p>

<p>Additionally, searchers can now see image and video results. Searchers can filter results to images or videos only. They can also see up to one inline video result with a link to see more videos.</p>

<p>To improve the quality of the image search results, we now display images from <a href="/manual/flickr.html">your Flickr photostream</a> by default.</p>

<p>We realized that our results page was getting a bit top-heavy so we now display inline results only when they're most relevant&mdash;capping the display of inline videos at 13 months and inline RSS-based news results at four months. Additionally, we display very recent news results (less than five days) at the top of the page and less recent news results closer to the bottom.</p>

<p>It is also now possible to include an email address as a header or footer link by using mailto:info@agency.gov within the URL.</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Searches for health-related information are very common. We created the Health Topics GovBox to help searchers find high-quality, authoritative health information.</p>

<p>This GovBox offers direct access to <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthtopics.html">MedlinePlus Health Topics</a> and open clinical studies and trials on <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. To provide timely information across all health topics, we pull the data from the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/xml.html">MedlinePlus XML files</a>, which cover both the English and Spanish health topics.</p>

<p>If you <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">opt to show the Health Topics GovBox</a>, searchers looking for health topics on your site can readily find high-quality health information, as shown in the sample below for a search on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nc.gov&amp;query=ovarian+cancer&amp;m=true"><em>ovarian cancer</em> on NC.gov</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighted Feature: Our New Search Results Page Is Now Available</h2>

<p>Our newly redesigned search results page is now available for use by early adopters.</p>

<p>Color pickers are in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>. You can customize each element on the page.</p>

<p>Searchers now see <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Related Sites</a> on all devices, and you can designate them in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>. You can customize the label for the Related Sites link. For example, <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?&amp;affiliate=kidsgov&amp;query=white+house+chef">Kids.gov</a> has chosen the label, <em>This topic on USA.gov</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?&amp;affiliate=kidsgov&amp;query=white+house+chef"><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/release-04-2014-kids.gov.png" title="Redesigned Kids.gov" alt="Redesigned Kids.gov" /></a></p>

<p>On the redesigned page, the <a href="/manual/brand.html">header and footer links</a> are viewable, with the header links appearing in an expandable "hamburger menu." Additionally, <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">Graphics Best Bets</a> appear in two columns for a clearer user experience.</p>

<p>Read the posts below to learn more about the redesign, why we did it, and how you can make the most of it.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We investigated the <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2014/04/08/OpenSSL-Heartbleed-Vulnerability">OpenSSL "Heartbleed" vulnerability</a>.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/downloads/1-1-0/">ElasticSearch 1.1.0</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to gain some performance improvements.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/february-2013.html"/>
    <updated>2014-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/february-2013.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>1. Tools for Filtering Results</h3>

<p>The display of search results pages is constantly evolving. Some changes are subtle. Others are more noticeable.</p>

<p>In line with industry best practices and commercial search engines, we've moved the tools for filtering and sorting results to the top of results list (rather than on the left side). We've also added an option to clear all filters.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/search-tools.png" alt="Tools for filtering and sorting" /></p>

<h3>2. Access Your Raw Logs</h3>

<p>You can now access your raw HTTP logs. These logs contain valuable data on searches, clicks and discovery tag page loads.</p>

<p>Read <em>How to Access Your Raw Logs</em> for more details about how to request secure FTP access to your logs.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers now see the most current titles and descriptions available for <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube videos</a> and they won't see any deleted videos.</li>
<li>Visitors to the pages search.usa.gov and buscador.usa.gov are now automatically redirected to <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa">GobiernoUSA.gov</a>, respectively, so they see the most recent content on these homepages.</li>
<li>Spanish searchers now see <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov">plain language</a> helper text.</li>
<li>Searchers no longer see two search boxes on the search results page, which will create a more visually appealing and usable page.</li>
<li>We open sourced all of the code that powers our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls Server API</a> in Github.</li>
<li>Searchers are now able to search and see results from collections that are not visible in the left-hand navigation on your "main" web results. You can use this option to provide a search box on a small subset of content (such as a policy manual or meeting minutes) while not cluttering up the left-hand navigation on your main results page. (It also helps reduce the likelihood that searchers experience a "dead end" on your main results page.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We rewrote some query routing rules for job searches to present more precise results in the <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a>.</li>
<li>We configured <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-CI</a> to enable continuous integration for the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls Server API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">Jobs Server API</a>.</li>
<li>We shortened the Jobs API base URL to <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search</a>.</li>
<li>We reconfigured our RSS feed fetching to update more efficiently.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/2/11/SEC-ANN-Rails-3-2-12-3-1-11-and-2-3-17-have-been-released">Rails 3.2.12</a> and <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rack">Rack</a> 1.4.5.</li>
<li>We upgraded our <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products/cdh.html">Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop</a> (CDH) cluster.</li>
<li>We removed the outdated yellow call out boxes from the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="%22http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released">Rails 3.2.11</a>.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> 6.3.</li>
<li>We optimized the routing of search queries so that they're served by the geographically closest datacenter.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>You'll no longer see an error message if you delete a site that has a YouTube profile or when adding a site that has no managed RSS feed.</li>
<li>Searchers no longer see Did You Mean suggestions for your excluded domains.</li>
<li>We fixed a cross browser compatibility issue on the Query Logs page in the Admin Center so that the number of clicks' column is now visible.</li>
<li>We labeled the Safe Search radio options on our <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?affiliate=govbenefits">advanced search page</a> as a fieldset to improve accessibility for screen readers.</li>

    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/august-2013.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlight: Download Your Raw Logs</h2>

<p>Do you want to know how many searches on your site are done from mobile devices? The times of day when searches peak? What people searched for before, during, and after a natural disaster, holiday, or other event?</p>

<p>These answers are now at your fingertips.</p>

<p>We've added a new feature so that you can access your raw HTTP logs via secure FTP. The logs include valuable data on searches, clicks, and discovery tag page loads so you can answer the questions above and any other ad hoc questions that come up.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers see a persistent Results by... logo above the footer on the search results page.</li>
<li>You can now start to use our <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">beta Admin Center</a>. We added a <a href="/tagged/dashboard">Dashboard</a> section to provide you with a snapshot of today's search data and manage your site's users and settings.</li>
<li>We migrated several pages to the following sections:

<ul>
<li><a href="/tagged/manage-content/">Manage Content</a> (Domains, Collections, Best Bets: Text, RSS, Flickr, Twitter, and YouTube),</li>
<li><a href="/tagged/analytics/">Analytics</a> (3rd Party Tracking), and</li>
<li><a href="/tagged/activate-search/">Activate Search</a> (Code Snippets and API Instructions) sections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We migrated our <a href="/manual/add-site.html">Add Site</a> page and the features that allows you to delete a site, add a specific URL, and filter a specific URL.</li>
<li>You can now see text descriptions when you mouse over the icons, a coming soon message for features that haven't yet been migrated, and our phone number on all pages of the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</li>
<li>Researchers can now browse and download <a href="https://explore.data.gov/Information-and-Communications/USA-gov-Search-Data/sarg-e9tw">USA.gov's search data</a> on <a href="http://www.data.gov/">Data.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We updated the images in our <a href="/manual/index.html">help files</a> to use https instead of http so that you don't see any security warnings.</li>
<li>We added <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to our results pages and Admin Center so that we can see how our service is being utilized across the board.</li>
<li>We started tracking and reporting on your <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">trending URLs</a> in today's snapshot.</li>
<li>You can no longer bulk upload domains.</li>
<li>We added the /sites URL for our beta <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> to our <a href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> configuration so that you see consistent analytics data no matter which one of our two datacenters you're hitting.</li>
<li>We now index <a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?organization_id=US-VA:CITY-ALEXANDRIA"> City of Alexandria, VA, jobs</a> in our <a href="/developer/jobs.html">Jobs API</a>.</li>
<li>We set up an automated report to check the HTTP status of all URLs in our list of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial <a href="http://govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/vocab/index.php">government URLs that aren't included in the .gov or .mil top-level domains</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed a bug with one our cron jobs that deleted all of our type-ahead search suggestions.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug so that Spanish-language sites now show the correct language on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page in the Admin Center.</li>
<li>We now keep your homepage URL populated on the <a href="/manual/add-site.html">Add Site</a> page, even if there's an error with your site handle.</li>
<li>We fixed two separate bugs that were making the Today's Snapshot and Best Bets:Text pages load too slowly.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug that was causing the <a href="/manual/add-site.html">Add Site</a> page to sometimes show the wrong help file.</li>
<li>We fixed the importer for our <a href="/developer/jobs.html">jobs API</a> to look for pubDate instead of pubdate.</li>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/serp-redesign-tips.html"/>
    <updated>2014-06-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/serp-redesign-tips.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you customize the <a href="/blog/serp-redesign.html">newly redesigned results page</a> to match your site's <a href="/manual/brand.html">brand</a>, we thought it'd be good to highlight some of our favorite tips.</p>

<h2>Image Assets</h2>

<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Display > Image Assets</p>

<p>A logo that has both the seal and agency name can provide a stronger identity than a seal only or a name only.</p>

<p>The addition of a name can also give the same seal two very different identities.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?&amp;m=&amp;affiliate=nmfs.noaa.gov&amp;query=fisheries">NOAA Fisheries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nodc.noaa.gov&amp;query=wilmington">NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Align your logo so its alignment is consistent with your website.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?&amp;m=&amp;affiliate=gobiernousa&amp;query=visas">GobiernoUSA.gov</a> has a left-aligned logo on its homepage and search results page.</li>
<li><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=bsee.gov&amp;query=deepwater+horizon">BSEE.gov</a> has a center-aligned logo on both of its pages.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fonts &amp; Colors</h2>

<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Display > Fonts &amp; Colors</p>

<p>Use a background color on the header, page body, or both. For best results, use different colors for the header and body.</p>

<ul>
<li>See contrasting background colors for both the header and body on <a href="http://search.broward.org/search?affiliate=co.broward.fl.us&amp;query=everglades">Broward County</a>.</li>
<li>See a background color for the body only on the <a href="http://search.bloomingtonmn.gov/search?&amp;affiliate=cityofbloomingtonmnsearchresults&amp;query=farmers+market">City of Bloomington, MN</a>.</li>
<li>And, for the header only on <a href="http://search.doi.gov/search?affiliate=doi.gov&amp;query=washington+monument">DOI.gov</a>.</li>
<li>Your background doesn't have to be a strong color. A light gray can provide subtle definition as seen on <a href="http://search.nih.gov/search?&amp;affiliate=nih&amp;query=library">NIH.gov</a>.</li>
<li>A good, strong color for the search button can go a long way, as seen <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?&amp;affiliate=kidsgov&amp;query=washington">Kids.gov</a>.</li>
<li>Especially buttons with a contrasting accent color like on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=gold&amp;affiliate=treasurydirect">TreasuryDirect</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Header &amp; Footer</h2>

<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Display > Header &amp; Footer</p>

<p>Use the footer to add navigation and required links.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?&amp;m=&amp;affiliate=usagov&amp;query=congress">USA.gov</a> is an example of a federal government website using this option.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?&amp;affiliate=thecityofminnnetonkasearchresults&amp;query=lakes">City of Minnetonka</a> is using the same set-up for a local government site.</li>
<li>It's also possible to add an email address to the footer or header by using mailto:info@agency.gov within the URL as <a href="http://search.uspto.gov/search?affiliate=web-sdmg-uspto.gov&amp;query=patents">USPTO.gov</a> has done for its option to email the USPTO Webmaster.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Display Overview</h2>

<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Display Overview</p>

<p>Shorter display names look best for the faceted search and related sites. Try to keep names under 15 characters.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=visas">USA.gov</a> has multiple faceted topics, and a related site for Spanish.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Content</h2>

<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content</p>

<p>Tell us about your social media content. Add your Flickr and Instagram accounts (or media RSS) so high-quality images appear in your search results.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/images?affiliate=blmca&amp;query=piedras+blancas">BLM California</a> and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/images?affiliate=www.louisiana.gov&amp;query=hurricanes">Louisiana.gov</a> display images from their Flickr photostreams.</li>
<li><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/news?&amp;affiliate=usgs&amp;channel=1438&amp;query=polar+bear">USGS.gov</a> displays images from its <a href="http://gallery.usgs.gov/">image gallery</a> (via media RSS feeds).</li>
</ul>


<p>Don't forget about adding Twitter and YouTube, too.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/rss.html"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > RSS</p>

<p>Would you like searchers to be able to search your news or multimedia content? Would you like them to be able to narrow results by date?</p>

<p>Tell us the locations and names of your RSS feeds. We index all new and updated content on your feeds within minutes.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Tell Us About Your RSS Feeds</h2>

<p>We love feeds! Tell us about <em>all</em> of your RSS feeds, even if you don't opt to show them in step 2 below. Feeds are the fastest and most reliable way for us to learn about your new and updated content.</p>

<p>Select the option to add a new RSS feed.</p>

<h3>Name</h3>

<p>Create a name for the feed. Within this 'bucket' you can list a single RSS feed or many feeds. For example, you can opt to list all of your agency's press releases separately (such as Police News, Fire News, EMS News, etc.) or you can list all three under one general name (such as News).</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/rss.png" alt="Add an RSS Feed" /></p>

<h3>Feed type</h3>

<p>Select the type of feed. The default option is RSS (for text content like press releases or blogs). Change it to <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss">media RSS</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> for multimedia content like images and videos.</p>

<p>Each item within a RSS feed must include a title, link, description, and publication date.</p>

<p>Each item within a media RSS feed must also include both a <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-content">media:content URL</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to specify a direct URL to the media object and a <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-thumbnails">media:thumbnail URL</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to specify a URL to the object's thumbnail.</p>

<p>Any items missing a required element won't display in your search results.</p>

<h3>Sample RSS Item with All Required Elements</h3>

&lt;![CDATA[ As schools close for the year and summer weather beckons, many recreationalists head to the Great Lakes' public beaches. However, these coastal areas can become  contaminated with disease-causing bacteria that threaten public health, disrupt water   recreation, and pay a toll on the Great Lakes economies that depend on summer tourism. ]]&gt;

<h2>Step 2. Opt to Show as a GovBox, in the Sidebar, or Both</h2>

<p>Allow searchers to see inline results for the three most recent, relevant RSS results <em>across all of your RSS feeds</em> by turning on the News GovBox on the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. You can also edit the default title, News, on the Display Overview page.</p>

<p>Allow searchers to see narrow results to a specific feed in the left-hand column of the results page by turning on the option to show in the Sidebar on the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. To ensure searchers don't encounter too many dead ends, we recommend showing only feeds with a significant amount of content as a sidebar option.</p>

<h2>Step 3. Check Your Search Results Page</h2>

<p><strong>GovBox.</strong> If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) as a GovBox, searchers will see a News GovBox. This GovBox will highlight the three most recent, relevant results across all of your RSS feeds.</p>

<p><strong>Sidebar.</strong> If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) in the sidebar, searchers can narrow their results to see your RSS-based results only.</p>

<p>Within the RSS-based results, searchers can opt to limit results to the last hour, day, week, month, or year, or they can set a custom date range. They also can sort results in descending order by relevance (best match first) or date (most recent first).</p>

<p>This third lecture honoring Joe focused on search engine optimization (SEO).</p>

<p>While commercial search engines do a remarkable job of helping the public find our government information, as web professionals, it's also our job to help the public make sense of what they find.</p>

<p>Ammie Farraj Feijoo, our program manager, presented on SEO for government websites and specifically talked about:</p>

<ul>
<li>What SEO is and why it is important;</li>
<li>SEO building blocks for writing content;</li>
<li>Conducting keyword research; and</li>
<li>Eliminating ROT (redundant, outdated, and trivial content).</li>
</ul>

<p>Provide us with the @handle for your Twitter account(s). Your @handle is your agency's username used within Twitter. When you're logged into Twitter, you can see your username at <a href="https://twitter.com/login?redirect_after_login=/settings/account">https://twitter.com/login?redirect_after_login=/settings/account</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>For example, the Twitter username for the Federal Student Aid, a part of the U.S. Department of Education, is <a href="https://twitter.com/FAFSA">@FAFSA</a>.</p>

<p>When you add your Twitter @handle, we'll automatically index and display <em>your</em> tweets. Select the option, Show tweets from my lists, to index the tweets for all members of your lists.</p>

<p>If you don't want to display your tweets, simply delete your Twitter handle.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows a recent tweet displayed on Federal Student Aid for a search on <em><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=loans&amp;op=Search&amp;affiliate=federalstudentaid&amp;m=true">loans</a></em>.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/serp-redesign.html"/>
    <updated>2014-05-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/serp-redesign.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/17/bing-reveals-its-redesign-and-latest-improvements/">Bing</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/20/privacy-focused-search-engine-duckduckgo-gets-a-new-look-smarter-search-with-instant-answers/">DuckDuckGo</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027704/how-googles-redesigned-search-results-augur-a-more-beautiful-web">Google</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, and <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/06/05/yahoo-redesigns-its-search-page/">Yahoo</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> have all rolled out major redesigns to their search results pages in the past year.</p>

<p>The last time we did a major redesign of our results page was in January 2012. It was long overdue for a facelift.</p>

<p>So, we've redesigned our search results page. We've kept an eye on best practices in the search industry and what media websites (like NPR.org and NYTimes.com) are up to, But, we're not simply following the leaders. We've also <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/07/analyzing-search-data-in-real-time-to-drive-decisions/">analyzed our search data</a> to make data-driven decisions that, ultimately, aim to improve searchers' experience on your site.</p>

<p>Below are some of the highlights.</p>

<h2>Basic Search Results</h2>

<p>We started with the basic search results because they're the meat of the page. They also have the highest clickthru rate among the various items shown on the page. Here's the before and after for a search on <em>passport</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-search-result.png" title="Search result for passport on USA.gov" alt="Search result for passport on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>We've done away with the underlining on the title. The snippet is wider and has more space. Clicking or touching anywhere on the snippet (not just the title) opens the link.</p>

<h2>Spelling Suggestions</h2>

<p>Spelling suggestions have the second highest clickthru rate so we focused on those next. Here's the before and after for a search on <em>manual noriega</em> (sic) on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-spelling.png" title="Spelling suggestion for manual noriega (sic) on USA.gov" alt="Spelling suggestion for manual noriega (sic) on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>We've done away with the wordiness and boldface. The suggestion and its corresponding option to override the automatic correction now use plain language and are shown on two lines. We now only use boldface to highlight keyword matches for searchers' queries.</p>

<h2>Search Verticals</h2>

<p>Through <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/digitalgov-user-experience-program/digitalgov-user-experience-program-test-support/">usability tests</a>, we found that searchers didn't see the options to change the scope of their results in the left-hand column. Data also supports this finding as very, very few searchers clicked on these options. Here's the before and after for a search on <em>jobs</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-verticals.png" title="Search verticals on USA.gov" alt="Search verticals on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new format clusters all options to narrow, broaden, or change the scope of the results together, and places these options directly above the search box. Searchers see up to three options and have the ability to show More &hellip;. The old format separated them, showing the option to search on related sites in the right-hand column above the box and verticals in the left-hand column below the box.</p>

<h2>Site Navigation</h2>

<p>Once visitors have opted to type a term in the search box, they're in search mode. Some have already tried and abandoned browsing the website.</p>

<p>To reflect visitors' shift from browsing to searching, search results pages on many commercial media websites highlight the search verticals and either remove or downplay the site's navigation. Here's the before and after for a search on <em>veterans affairs</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-navigation.png" title="Site brand and navigation on USA.gov" alt="Site brand and navigation on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new format prominently shows the search verticals above the search box. Searchers can click the logo to return to homepage, or expand the "hamburger" menu to view additional options to browse the site. Searchers can also browse the site using links in the footer.</p>

<h2>Videos</h2>

<p>Eye tracking studies have shown searchers gravitate to video thumbnails. Snippets are also very important to increase clickthru rates. Searchers are more likely to view a video if they understand how it relates to what they're looking for. Here's the before and after for a search on <em>careers</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-video.png" title="Video search result for careers on USA.gov" alt="Video search result for careers on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new video format shows one video plus a clearly labeled "More videos about ..." link. It also shows the video's source (in this case YouTube), the length of the video, and a short snippet. The video is now separated from basic search results by thin grey lines.</p>

<p>Searchers now see inline videos from the past 13 months only. (It used to be forever.) There's a spike in video views at around one year so this time period allows searchers to see recent inline videos for annual events like tax season, national health observances, and holidays.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>tornadoes</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-news.png" title="News search results for tornado on USA.gov" alt="News search results for tornado on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new news format now matches the look of the basic search results to provide a more seamless experience.</p>

<p>Searchers now see inline news from the last four months only. (It used to be forever, which showed stale content from several years ago in some cases.) Very recent news (less than five days) shows above the basic search results. Less recent but still timely news (greater than five days and less than four months) shows below the basic search results. The old format always showed news results after the third web result.</p>

<h2>Tweets</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>social security</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-tweet.png" title="Tweet for social security on USA.gov" alt="Tweet for social security on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new tweet format shows one tweet inline with the results. It now shows the agency's Twitter profile image and the tweet is separated from basic search results by thin grey lines and doesn't have a separate heading. As tweets tend to be very time-sensitive, searchers now see tweets from the last three days only. (It used to be 30 days.) The old format showed tweets in a right-hand column that was often mistaken for an ad.</p>

<h2>Job Openings</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>communications jobs</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-jobs.png" title="Job results for communications jobs on USA.gov" alt="Job results for communications jobs on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new job opening format shows up to three job openings inline with the results. Searchers can now click or touch the down arrow to see up to 10 listings inline. For federal agencies, it now shows the USAJobs logo to clearly identify that as the data source. The job openings are separated from basic search results by thin grey lines. The old format showed jobs in a right-hand column that was often mistaken for an ad and didn't give searchers the option to see more listings on the results page.</p>

<h2>Health Topics</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>diabetes</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-health-govbox.png" title="Health topic result for diabetes on USA.gov" alt="Health topic result for diabetes on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new health topics format shows a shorter, more concise snippet and the snippet doesn't have any embedded links. The result now takes up less vertical space as the links for related topics and clinical trials are each listed in a line. The MedlinePlus logo now links to <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/</a>.</p>

<h2>By Government, for Government</h2>

<p>Our search results page now ensures the public has a common search experience anywhere, anytime, and on any device. This meets a key objective of the federal government's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a>.</p>

<p>It has also been tested to ensure it is <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">accessible to people with disabilities</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/govbox-jobs.html"/>
    <updated>2014-05-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/govbox-jobs.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common search tasks is to look for current job openings. We created the Jobs GovBox to help searchers quickly find relevant jobs.</p>

<p>When you <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">turn on the Job Openings GovBox</a>, searchers looking for jobs on your site will see up to three relevant jobs listings on your results page.</p>

<h2>Federal Government</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Cross-Agency Portals.</strong> If your website is a federal cross-agency portal (e.g., USA.gov), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all federal agencies</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Department Websites.</strong> If your website is affiliated with a specific federal department (e.g., Department of Commerce), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all agencies within your department</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Agency or Office Websites.</strong> If your website is affiliated with a specific federal agency (e.g., NOAA) or office (e.g, National Ocean Service), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location-and keyword-matched job openings <em>at your agency</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Searchers will also see a direct link to <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov">USAJobs.gov</a> for all current job openings (specific to your department or agency, if applicable), as shown in the sample below for a search on <a href="http://search.doi.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=doi.gov&amp;query=jobs" title=""><em>jobs</em></a> on DOI.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/govbox-jobs.png" alt="Search results for jobs on DOI.gov" /></p>

<h2>State and Local Government</h2>

<p>If your website is a state or local government site that uses both DigitalGov Search and NeoGov (e.g., Michigan.gov), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across your agency</em>.</p>

<p>Searchers will also see a direct link to your NeoGov page for all current job openings specific to your agency, as shown in the sample below for a search on <em><a href="http://search.ci.bloomington.mn.us/search?affiliate=cityofbloomingtonmnsearchresults&amp;query=jobs">jobs</a></em> on the City of Bloomington, MN.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/jobs-bloomington.png" alt="Search results for jobs on ci.bloomington.mn.us" /></p>

<p>Otherwise, the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all federal, state, and local agencies</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p> <strong>Did you know?</strong> Are you a federal agency that doesn't post your jobs on USAJobs? Or a local or state government that doesn't use NeoGov? We want your jobs data.

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/march-2014.html"/>
    <updated>2014-04-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/march-2014.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>Feature 1. We migrated from Solr to Elasticsearch.</h3>

<p>Open source search technology has improved rapidly in recent years. To keep pace, we upgraded from Solr to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>We've realized many benefits. Loren Siebert, one of our software engineers, <a href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/search-big-data.html">recently presented</a> on some lessons we've learned and the evolution of open source search technology in general.</p>

<h3>Feature 2. We're continuing to go responsive.</h3>

<p>Based your feedback, searchers now see a larger logo when they search from their desktop computers.</p>

<p>Searchers now see the <a href="/manual/govbox-health.html">Health GovBox</a> when they search from a mobile phone or tablet.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/feature-2014-02-01-newserp-health-gb.png" title="Health GovBox for a search on diabetes on USA.gov" alt="Health GovBox for a search on diabetes on USA.gov" /></p>

<h3>Feature 3. Searchers now see higher quality RSS search results.</h3>

<p>We're working to improve the search experience for your <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>. Below are the first two improvements we made. Many more are on the way over the next few months.</p>

<ul>
<li>Searchers now see only unique URLs in the News GovBox. (We previously didn't dedupe URLs that belonged to multiple feeds.)</li>
<li>Searchers now see only valid, resolving URLs. (We previously didn't revisit your older URLs to remove those with 404 errors.)</li>
</ul>


<p>See, for example, the Most recent... results for a <a href="http://search.ers.usda.gov/search?affiliate=ers&amp;query=corn&amp;m=true">search on corn on ERS.gov</a>.</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>The option to narrow results to images only is now opt-in. To override the default, turn on the images sidebar option on the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page in the Admin Center.</li>
<li>We sped up the cron job that generates the monthly and weekly CSV files on the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page in the Admin Center.</li>
<li>We prototyped using the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/">ELK stack</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> ( <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/logstash">Logstash</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana">Kibana</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>) for our search analytics.</li>
<li>We fixed our <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> builds.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/downloads/1-0-1/">Elasticsearch 1.0.1</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
<li>We now route traffic evenly between our two datacenters.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The last two columns are no longer dropped when you bulk upload <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">text best bets</a>.</li>
<li>Searchers no longer get intermittently "stuck" on page one of the results.</li>
<li>Searchers no longer lose their spot on the results page after they opt to see more job openings.</li>
</ul>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[I Didn't Try to Grow a Bigger Ox:  How I Found Hadoop]]></title>
    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html"/>
    <updated>2014-03-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago I rolled my first Hadoop system into production. Since then, I've spoken to quite a few people who are eager to try Hadoop themselves in order to solve their own big data problems. Despite having similar backgrounds and data problems, few of these people have sunk their teeth into Hadoop. When I go to Hadoop Meetups in San Francisco, I often meet new people who are evaluating Hadoop and have yet to launch a cluster. Based on my own background and experience, I have some ideas on why this is the case.</p>

<p>I studied computer science in school and have worked on a wide variety of computer systems in my career, with a lot of focus on server-side Java. I learned a bit about building distributed systems and working with large amounts of data when I built a pay-per-click (PPC) ad network in 2004. The system is still in operation and at one point was handling several thousand searches per second. As the sole technical resource on the system, I had to educate myself very quickly about how to scale up.</p>

<p>As I contemplated how doomed I would be should traffic levels increase much more, I remember wondering to myself, "How does Google deal with all that data?" The answer came to me in the form of the Google File System (GFS) paper and later the MapReduce paper, both from Google. It dawned on me that because Google was forced to solve a much larger problem, they had come up with an elegant solution for a whole range of more modest data problems running on commodity hardware. But it wouldn't be until 2010 that I would get to work with this technology firsthand.</p>

<p>As I wrote in an <a href="/blog/adopting-hadoop.html">earlier article</a>, I started re-architecting DigitalGov Search, the U.S. government's search system, in 2009 based on a solution stack of free, open source software including Ruby on Rails, Solr, and MySQL. A wave of déja vu hit me as I started worrying about what to do with the growing mountain of data piling up in MySQL and our increasing need to analyze it in different ways. I had heard that a new company called Cloudera, founded by some big data people from Yahoo!, Google, and Facebook, was making Hadoop available for the masses in a reliable distribution, much in the same way that RedHat did for Linux. Curiosity got the best of me and I bought the newly minted <em>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</em> from O'Reilly. The most insightful part of the book to me was the very first sentence. It's a quote from Grace Hopper: "In pioneer days, they used oxen for heavy pulling, and when one ox couldn't budge a log, they didn't try to grow a bigger ox." I didn't want to grow a bigger server; I wanted to harness a bunch of small servers together to work in unison. The more I learned the more curious I got, so I started reading more. And that's when I hit my first roadblock.</p>

<p>I think people who have been working with Hadoop technologies for years and years sometimes forget just how rich and diverse the big data software ecosystem has become, and how daunting it can be to folks approaching it for the first time. When people at the Meetups say they are evaluating solutions to their data scaling problem, the answers they hear sound something like this: "Just use Hadoop Hive Pig Mahout Avro HBase Cassandra Oozie Sqoop Flume ZooKeeper Cascading NoSQL RCFile. Oh, almost forgot…cloud."</p>

<p>The thought of wading through all of that just to learn about what I needed to learn about was a bit too overwhelming for me, so I put the whole matter aside for a few months. Over time, I started to dive into each of these projects to understand the primary use case, how active the developer community was and which organizations were using it in production. I converged on the idea of using Hive as a warehouse for our data. I opted for Cloudera's distribution since I wanted to reduce the risk of running into compatibility issues between all the various subsystems. Having tracked down anomalies in a highly multi-threaded and contentious distributed Java system before, I liked the idea of someone else taking on that problem for me.</p>

<p>At some point, I had read everything I could read and grew impatient to get my hands dirty, so I decided to just download CDH3 on my laptop and give it a try. The tutorial instructions for the standalone version worked, and I successfully computed more digits of pi than I ever thought I'd need. After creating some sample data in Hive and running a few queries, I felt pretty confident that Hive would be the right tool for the job. I just needed to find somewhere to install and run HDFS (namenode, secondary namenode, and data nodes), Hadoop (jobtracker and tasktracker nodes), Hive, and Hue for a nice front end to it all.</p>

<p>I knew from my past experience how to stretch the limits of CPU, disk, IO, and memory on commodity servers, and I identified a few potential servers at our primary datacenter with resources I figured I could leverage. Once again I followed the tutorial instructions, this time for the fully distributed version of CDH3, and once again I started to compute pi. And that's when I hit my second roadblock. It took me a few days to figure out that I had a problem with DNS. Each machine needs to be able to resolve every other machine's name and IP in the cluster. Whether you do that via /etc/hosts or a local DNS server is up to you, but it needs to happen or the whole thing gets wedged. Once I got that sorted out, everything just started falling into place and I had Hive working in production within a few days. A week later, I started pulling out the MySQL jobs and deleting big tables, and that's been the trend ever since.</p>

<p>Over time, I've gone on to learn about using custom Ruby mappers in Hive, moving data back and forth between MySQL and Hive with Sqoop, and getting the data into HDFS in real-time with Flume. All of these components from the Cloudera distribution are working nicely in our production environment now, and I sleep well at night knowing I have such a solid, deliberate plan for growth. My initial investment in learning about the Hadoop ecosystem is really paying dividends, but when I think about all those people at the Meetups stuck in evaluation mode, I feel their pain. Does it have to be such a struggle?</p>

<p>The big challenge in my opinion is not that any one piece of the puzzle is too difficult. Any reasonably smart (or in my case stubborn) engineer can set themselves on the task of learning about a new technology once they know that it needs to be learned. The challenge with the Hadoop ecosystem is that it presents the newbie with the meta-problem of figuring out which of these tools are appropriate for their use case at all, and whether or not to even consider the problem today versus deferring it until later. In a way Facebook has it easy, because when you are adding 15TB of data per day, that decision is pretty much made for you.</p>

<p>For all the companies sitting in the twilight between the gigabyte and the petabyte who don't have Hadoop expertise in-house, there is a collection of free information to help guide people to the right solution space (Hadoop Tutorial, White Papers). These days, when I talk to people who are evaluating solutions to their big data problems, my advice to them is to break down their problems into a few discrete use cases and then work on ferreting out the technologies that are designed for that use case. Get a proof of concept to demonstrate that the technology can address your use case and convince yourself and others that you're on the right track. Work toward putting something simple into production. Lather, rinse, and repeat. I am still in that cycle myself, as these days I'm exploring HBase and OpenTSDB to give me low-latency access to time series data and Mahout to do frequent item set mining, but that's another article for another day.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>3 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>Feature 1. Analyze Searchers' Click Behavior</h3>

<p>Clickthru rates (CTR) can indicate the relevance of your results for specific search terms. You can now see (a) the CTR for your top 1,000 <a href="/manual/queries.html">queries</a> and (b) your top <a href="/manual/clicks.html">clicked URLs</a>. The data are updated in real time.</p>

<p>Use the data to find searches with low CTRs. For these queries, consider if a low CTR is good or not. (A low CTR can be good when searchers see the answer directly on the results page, eliminating the need to click on a link.) For those that aren't good, tweak your page's title or content, add a new page to your site, or add a <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">best bet</a> to point to the relevant page on another agency's site.</p>

<h3>Feature 2. Analyze the Terms that Trigger Best Bets</h3>

<p>Have you ever wondered what search terms make your <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">best bets</a> appear? From the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page, you can now drill down to see a pie chart of the terms that trigger each best bet. The data are updated in real time.</p>

<p>Use the data to tweak your best bet's title, description, and keyword phrases. Or, use it to decide to delete the best bet altogether.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/feature-bb-trigger.png" title="Pie Chart of Terms Triggering a Best Bet" alt="Pie Chart of Terms Triggering a Best Bet" /></p>

<h3>Feature 3. Use Keyword Phrases to Show Best Bets Only When They're Relevant</h3>

<p>Have you ever seen a <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">best bet</a> when you don't expect it to appear? Best bet keywords are now <em>phrases</em>. This change allows you to show a best bet only when its keyword is an <em>exact match</em> with a searcher's query.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/feature-improved-phrasing.png" title="Best Bets Now Use Keyword Phrases" alt="Best Bets Now Use Keyword Phrases" /></p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed some errors with URL shortening.</li>
<li>We updated our stemming file so searchers no longer see irrelevant results for intern.</li>
<li>We replaced Jenkins with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
<li>We fixed a time setting on our API machine.</li>
<li>We upgraded Java on our API and <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/home.html">Cloudera</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> machines.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed the layout of graphic best bets so results are shown in vertical, newspaper style columns. We also added more spaces between links.</li>
<li>Spanish language searchers no longer see spelling suggestions for terms with and without diacritics.</li>
<li>We renamed the IP deduped column <i>Real Count (Humans Only)</i> in the downloadable CSV file on the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page.</li>
<li>We updated our mobile search results page to show a more/less symbol only when it is applicable.</li>
<li>We fixed the search box on our mobile results page so searchers can easily remove previous queries from the search box and so long mobile search terms don't overlap with the 'x' on the right.</li>
<li>Best bets now appear even when there are no web results.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Slowness Hurts Web Pages</h2>

<p>Have you ever been frustrated when visiting a web page that doesn't load quickly? Have you ever left a slow web page before it finished loading? You're not alone.</p>

<p>Several recent studies have quantified customers' frustration with slow web pages. Customers now  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html">expect results in the blink of an eye</a>.&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> This expection means that your <a href="http://www.aberdeen.com/Aberdeen-Library/5136/RA-performance-web-application.aspx">customers are won or lost in one second</a>.&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> A one second delay in loading a web page equals 11% fewer page views, 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, and 7% loss in conversions.</p>

<h2>Slowness <em>Kills</em> Search Results Pages</h2>

<p>As little time as web sites have to keep users on their pages, search engines have even less time to keep searchers on their results pages. Speed is the primary factor in determining customers' satisfaction with search results.</p>

<p>Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo garner <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/11/comScore_Releases_October_2013_US_Search_Engine_Rankings">95% of the search market</a>.&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> Google garners two-thirds of the search market. The company's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Google+Gospel+of+Speed">Gospel of Speed</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> motto is one reason why Google garners the majority of the market.</p>

<p>This gospel has also set a high bar for all search engines. Searchers expect results pages to load very, very quickly.</p>

<h2>How We've Made Our Result Pages Load Faster</h2>

<p>So, when we established the service's open source architecture in 2010, the first thing we tackled was how to deliver our search results in under one second.</p>

<p>At around the same time, <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> was experiencing exponential growth and the company's engineers were blogging about what they did to make Github fast. To get up to speed quickly (yes, bad pun intended), we read their posts.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blog/530-how-we-made-github-fast">How We Made GitHub Fast</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, October 20, 2009</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blog/1252-how-we-keep-github-fast">How We Keep GitHub Fast</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, September 5, 2012</li>
</ul>


<p>Leveraging some of Github's best practices, we succeeded in delivering our results in under 700 milliseconds, on average. This was a significant accomplishment and improvement from the previous vendor-owned and -operated iterations of our service.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, we've dug in and improved our response time even more. We now deliver our results in under 380 milliseconds, on average.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/serp_reponse_times.png" title="App server response times" alt="App server response times" /></p>

<p>We already had an architecture optimized for speed. So, how have we sped it up by 320 milliseconds?</p>

<h3>We Cache When We Can</h3>

<p>When a searcher enters a query, we go out to our various indexes, pull the information relevant to the searcher's request, and put that information together on the results page.</p>

<p>Most queries (such as jobs, obama, unclaimed money, forms) aren't unique and are asked by thousands of searchers each day.</p>

<p>We cache these so-called short head queries and store them on our servers. Caching helps us speed up the above process because searchers don't have to wait for us to pull the information from its original source.</p>

<h3>We Use an Asset Pipeline</h3>

<p>We have many JavaScript and CSS files on our results pages. These "assets" can be large and slow down the loading of our page. So, we use an <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">asset pipeline</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to concatenate and compress our JavaScript and CSS assets thereby reducing the number of requests that a browser has to make to render our results page.</p>

<p>We also use fingerprinting&mdash;a technique that makes a file's name dependent on its content&mdash;within our asset pipeline. When the content changes, the name changes. For content that is static or that changes infrequently, this naming helps us tell whether two versions of a file are identical. When a filename is unique, browsers keep their own copy of the content. When the content is updated, the fingerprint changes so browsers request a new copy of the content. This approach allows us to maximize our content delivery network.</p>

<h3>We Use a Content Delivery Network</h3>

<p>Our static content (such as scripts and stylesheets) gets served through our <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">content delivery network</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> provider, currently Akamai. Akamai serves our static content from its server that is geographically closest to the searcher. The closer, the faster.</p>

<p>Using a content delivery network also allow us to optimize our service's speed by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Directing non-cached traffic between our two datacenters to create a <a href="/releases/2012-10-19.html">multihomed environment</a>. Multihoming allows us to make full use of all of our servers. By contrast, in 2010, our disaster recovery datacenter often sat idle.</li>
<li>Reducing our need to add bandwidth or servers to handle short-term traffic spurts, such as spurts related to natural disasters.</li>
<li>Protecting against denial of service attacks by spotting them before they reach our servers.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>We've worked hard over the past three years to speed up the delivery of our results by optimizing each link in the chain.</p>

<p>We use several monitoring tools to measure our system's performance. The quality of these tools is improving at a rapid pace, which in turn, shows us where and how we can improve our service.</p>

<p>We regularly ask ourselves, "Will <em>this</em> shave some time off and help us deliver our results in <em>under</em> 380 milliseconds?"</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlight: Compare Your Click-thru Rate to the Average Rate</h2>

<p>How do you stack up? You can now compare your click-thru rate (CTR) with the average rate across all sites that use DigitalGov Search. Use your CTR data to measure the performance of specific campaigns and modules.</p>

<p>For example, October's Monthly Report for <a href="http://kids.usa.gov/">Kids.gov</a> shows the average CTR for Best Bets: Graphics on Kids.gov is 26.8%, while the average CTR across all DigitalGov Search sites is 14.0%. Their <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">graphic best bets</a> are very effective compared to other sites.</p>

<p>See how Kids.gov's other modules stack up against the average below.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/releases-kidsgov-ctr.png" alt="Average CTR" /></p>

<p>This means that the graphic best bets (such as seen for a <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=kidsgov&amp;query=george+washington">search on <em>George Washington</em> on Kids.gov</a>) are almost twice as likely to be clicked on Kids.gov than other sites.</p>

<p>It's important to remember your audience. <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2012/08/06/how-kids-search/">Kids use search differently than adults</a> and they're probably more attracted to graphic images.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/releases-kidsgov-bbg.png" alt="George Washington Best Bets: Graphic" /></p>

<p>Go to the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> to see how you stack up.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>We made the final cutover to our new Admin Center. As part of the cutover, we updated all of our <a href="/manual/index.html">help files</a> and removed 404 pages from our search results. We also migrated our <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">Best Bets: Graphics</a> and My Account pages.</li>
<li>You're no longer asked to provide a phone number or address when you <a href="https://search.usa.gov/signup">register for a new account</a>.</li>
<li>Librarians, developers, and others can see a list of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial <a href="http://govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/">government URLs</a> that aren't .gov or .mil.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We applied updates to our operating system from <a href="http://ezix.org/project/wiki/HardwareLiSter">Hardware Lister</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, and our <a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=tzdata">Time Zone data</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
<li>We set up <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to identify areas of our code that can be improved.</li>
<li>We phased out color schemes and now offer two options, default and custom.</li>
<li>We updated the links in our email templates to reflect the new Admin Center.</li>
<li>We added the <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> tag to our results pages by default.

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/monthly-reports.html"/>
    <updated>2013-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/monthly-reports.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Analytics > Monthly Reports</p>

<p>The monthly report gives a bird's-eye view of the number of <a href="/manual/queries.html">queries</a> and <a href="/manual/clicks.html">clicks</a> each month.</p>

<p>Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>Data start from the time your agency started using our service (but no further back than 2009).</p>

<h2>Monthly Usage Stats</h2>

<p>Data for the total number of queries and clicks. Use this report to find and analyze the so-called <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/analysis/long-tail.html">short head</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> of your most popular search queries and clicks, which are typically the same as your site's <a href="http://www.usability.gov/tags/task-analysis/">top tasks</a>.</p>

<h2>Impressions and Clicks by Module</h2>

<p>Detailed data for the total number of impressions and clicks and your clickthru rate (CTR) are presented for each "module" on the search results page. We also provide the average CTR across all DigitalGov Search customers so you can see how your rate compares to the average rate. The data in the table is sorted in descending order from the most to least number of clicks.</p>

<p>Use this report to inform which <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">modules you opt to display</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Drill down into best bets.</em></strong> Select the option to drill down into your <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bets:Text</a> or <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">Best Bets: Graphics</a> to see the number of impressions, number of clicks, and CTR for each best bet. The data in the table is sorted in descending order from the highest to lowest CTR. Review and edit best bets as needed. Focus on those with a high number of impressions and low CTR to make the biggest impact on searchers' experience (and on your overall CTR). Select drill down again to see a pie chart of the search terms that led to an impression on each best bet.</p>

<h2>Download Top Queries</h2>

<p>View a detailed report of the number of times searchers have input specific terms and phrases by clicking on the CSV (comma-separated values) link to download the list as a text file. Once you've downloaded the CSV file, you can easily <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-HP010342598.aspx">import it  into Excel</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> or another speadsheet program to analyze the data.</p>

<p>The CSV file contains three columns: (1) query, (2) raw count, and (3) IP-deduped.</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/10/24/understanding-your-users-needs-by-analyzing-search-terms/">Understanding Your Users' Needs By Analyzing Search Terms</a> for tips on how to create a semi-automated report for analyzing the data in this CSV file on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>All data presented on this page (and other pages in the Admin Center) are IP-deduped to exclude bots and other noise in an attempt to accurately represent searchers' intent on your site. Some definitions follow.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/manual/queries.html">Queries</a>:</strong> Number of times a search query (that is, a word or string of words) was entered in the search box by a unique searcher.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/manual/clicks.html">Clicks</a>.</strong> Number of times a searcher clicked on one of your pages within the search results for a particular query.</p>

<p><strong>Impressions:</strong> Number of times a module is displayed, whether it is clicked on or not. Not all modules are displayed for all queries. Each time a module is displayed it is counted as one impression.</p>

<p><strong>Clickthru Rate (CTR):</strong> The rate (expressed in a percentage) at which searchers click on a module. This rate is calculated by dividing the total number of clicks by the total number of impressions. CTR is useful to measure the performance of specific campaigns, such as <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">best bets</a> for seasonal events.</p>

<p><strong>Raw count:</strong> Total number of times the query was submitted. The raw count is provided in the downloadable CSV files only.</p>

<p><strong>IP-deduped count:</strong> Total number of times the query was submitted by any one IP address. This excludes bots and other traffic that send in a query multiple times from one IP address. It is often a more accurate representation of "real," human traffic.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> On the first of each month, we email you a report with data on the previous month's queries, clicks, and top search terms.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> The <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Site Overview</a> provides a snapshot of what has been happening on your site in the past day or so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlight: Visit the Revamped Admin Center</h2>

<p>We're excited to release our newly revamped <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>. Be sure to update your bookmarks!</p>

<p>After you log in, the new Default Site feature lets you set the site you see by default. We've automatically set it as your highest-traffic site. You can change the default site by clicking on the pin icon next to your selected site.</p>

<p>Among the new features are Today's Snapshot, where we've placed the snapshot of today's search data front and center.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/todays-snapshot.png" alt="Today's Snapshot" /></p>

<p>On <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Today's Snapshot</a>, you can view top queries and clicks, trending queries and URLs, queries with no results, and queries with low click thrus.</p>

<p><a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly reports</a> and <a href="/manual/queries.html">query</a> and <a href="/manual/clicks.html">click</a> stats are also available through the new Analytics section.</p>

<p>We've also made it easier for you to manage the content that displays on your search results page by placing it all within one section, Manage Content.</p>

<p>Another section, Manage Display, makes it easier for you turn <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">display features</a> on and off and to <a href="/manual/brand.html">brand</a> your results page by selecting your font and color scheme, managing your image assets, and adding header and footer links. Plus, you can now edit the 'News' label on the News Govbox.</p>

<p>You can read our updated help by clicking on the Help? link on each page in the Admin Center, or see the full set of help files on our <a href="/manual/index.html">How to Set Up Your Search Box</a> page.</p>

<p>Email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x73;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#46;&#100;&#105;&#103;&#x69;&#116;&#x61;&#x6c;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#x2e;&#x67;&#111;&#118;">&#x73;&#101;&#x61;&#x72;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#114;&#116;&#46;&#x64;&#x69;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#x61;&#x6c;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;</a> to let us know if you have other ideas for how we can improve our Admin Center.</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We made <a href="/manual/twitter.html">tweet</a> queries two orders of magnitude, or 130ms, faster and pruned older tweets from our index to increase retrieval speeds.</li>
<li>We upgraded our <a href="https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/6.3_Release_Notes/index.html">RedHat channel</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> from 6.2 to 6.3.</li>
<li>We moved some servers to a new datacenter and resolved a bandwidth issue between our datacenters.</li>
<li>We sent Microsoft an updated list of federal, state, and local government domains that aren't .gov or .mil so that searchers can get results from these websites on <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We updated our stemming file to fix a stemming issue with organ* so that searches on organic no longer find results for organizations, organisms, or other irrelevant terms.</li>
<li>We removed the 'www' for newly added sites so the default <a href="/manual/domains.html">domain</a> is now agency.gov, not www.agency.gov.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Queries page reports on the number of times a search query (that is, a word or string of words) was entered in the search box on your site by a unique searcher.</p>

<p>Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>Data start from the time your agency started using our service (but no further back than 2009).</p>

<h2>Top Queries</h2>

<p><strong><em>Top 1,000.</em></strong> You'll see a list, in frequency order, of top 1,000 most popular queries for your selected time period.</p>

<p><strong><em>Top 1,000 by query.</em></strong> Enter any specific term or phrase into the Query search box. Re-generate the report to see the top 1,000 queries that contain that term or phrase and its stemmed equivalents.</p>

<p>For example, below are the top 10 queries related to <em>housing</em> on USA.gov in August 2013.</p>

<ol>
<li>house of representatives</li>
<li>housing</li>
<li>speaker of the house</li>
<li>white house</li>
<li>house minority leader</li>
<li>housing assistance</li>
<li>house majority leader</li>
<li>speaker of the house 2013</li>
<li>the white house</li>
<li>houses</li>
</ol>

<p>If you click on the first-listed <em>www.house.gov</em> in the example above, you'll see that the top queries leading to a click on that URL are:</p>

<ol>
<li>house of representatives</li>
<li>congress</li>
<li>congress members</li>
<li>congress representatives</li>
</ol>


<p>You can loop through or drill down into this list for any set of clicks and queries.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Use Advanced Options to Add or Filter Specific URLs]]></title>
    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/domains-advanced.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> > Advanced</p>

<h2>Add a URL</h2>

<p>Are specific web pages missing from your Bing web results? Tell us about these URLs and we'll append them to your web results. We offer two ways for you to tell us about the web pages that you want us to fetch and include in our web index, via an RSS feed (Supplemental Feed) or manually (Supplemental URLs).</p>

<h3>Supplemental Feed</h3>

<p>You can use an RSS feed to add URLs. The feed is useful if you'd like to automate the process, add multiple URLs, or both.</p>

<p>Enter the URL of your RSS feed. Click submit. We'll fetch each URL in your feed and index the title, description, <em>and the full text of the document</em> for the items you provide. We'll display the title and description you provide (not the page's title or a snippet based on the page's content).</p>

<p>Delete a URL added via RSS feed by deleting it as an item in your RSS feed. We'll remove the URL from our index the next time we fetch your RSS feed. If you need to remove it from our index immediately, you can take the additional step of deleting the URL by selecting Delete within the list of URLs on the Supplemental URLs page.</p>

<p>Note that you <em>must</em> delete the URL from your RSS feed. Otherwise, the URL will reappear the next time we fetch your RSS feed.</p>

<p>You can also delete <em>all</em> of the URLs added via the RSS feed by deleting the RSS feed itself.</p>

<p>We can't restore URLs that don't exist within your <em>current</em> feed.</p>

<h3>Supplemental URLs</h3>

<p>You can also manually add a a specific URL on the Supplemental URLs page. We'll fetch each URL you add manually and we'll index the title, description, <em>and the full text of the document</em> for the link you provide. We'll display the title and description you provide (not the page's title or a snippet based on the page's content).</p>

<p>Delete a manually added URL by selecting Delete within the list of supplemental URLs.</p>

<p>The source column in the crawl report shows how you added the URL, via an RSS feed or manually.</p>

<h2>Filter a URL</h2>

<p>You can filter <em>a single URL</em> from the results on your site. Use it for emergency reasons only (such as spillage of classified information or unintentional publication of a page). Note that this option should be used only if the <a href="/manual/domains.html#filter">other options</a> aren't feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.</p>

<p>It is not meant to fix the results for entire site, such as for launch or redesign problems. For tips on how to fix these more systemic problems, read our <a href="/blog/redesign.html">Checklist for a Successful Website Redesign</a>.</p>

<p>Entire the full path of the URL, e.g. use http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Benefits.shtml, not usa.gov/citizen/topics.</p>

<p>You can later use the delete option to remove the filter.</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report for your PDF that says, "No content found in document"? Your PDF is likely an image-only, non-searchable file that was created from a paper document using a scanner. See the resources below for more information on how to create searchable PDF files.</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report that says your page is taking too long to load? Use <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/">Pingdom Tools Full Page Test</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to test the load time of your page, analyze it, and find the bottlenecks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> To help the public find your web pages when they search on Bing.com, we notify Bing about any URLs you add. While this helps with search engine optimization (SEO), it is not a cure-all. You should also register for and use commercial search engines' webmaster tools.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > Domains</p>

<p>Enter the applicable domains, subdomains, or folders to return results specific to your website. You do not need to include http:// as we recognize domains with or without it.</p>

<h2>Entire Site(s)</h2>

<ul>
<li>List yoursite.gov (without www) to search your entire site, including all subdomains.</li>
<li>List yoursite.gov and yoursite2.gov to search multiple sites.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Specific Subdomains</h2>

<ul>
<li>List www.yoursite.gov to include only the primary 'www' domain.</li>
<li>List subdomain.yoursite.gov to include subdomains.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Specific Directories</h2>

<p>List yoursite.gov/folder to include folders. Note: this will include all sub-folders (if they exist), i.e. yoursite.gov/folder/folder2.</p>

<p>You cannot specify individual URLs.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> You can <em>exclude</em> specific subdomains or folders using any of the following options.</p>

<ol>
<li>List the excluded subdomains or folders in your <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org">robots.txt</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> file. This blocks them from all crawlers that follow the robots exclusion protocol, including Google.com and Bing.com.</li>
<li>Exclude them by omission. For example, to exclude subdomain3, list only subdomain1.yoursite.gov, subdomain2.yoursite.gov, and subdomain4.yoursite.gov.</li>
<li>Email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x73;&#x65;&#x61;&#114;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#x72;&#x74;&#x2e;&#100;&#x69;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#97;&#108;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;">&#x73;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#104;&#x40;&#x73;&#x75;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#x74;&#x2e;&#100;&#105;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#97;&#x6c;&#x67;&#111;&#118;&#x2e;&#103;&#111;&#x76;</a> to filter them from your site's search results. Note that this option should be used only if the other options aren't feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.</li>
</ol>


<p><a id="filter"></a><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> You can remove or filter specific URLs using any of the following options.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Remove the page from your site and return a 404 (Not Found) 401 (Gone), or 301 (Permanently Moved) HTTP status.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/control-crawl-index/docs/robots_meta_tag?csw=1">noindex robots metatag or x-robots tag</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. This blocks them from all crawlers that follow the robots exclusion protocol, including Google.com and Bing.com.</p></li>
<li><p>Request the page's removal using the <a href="http://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/block-urls-from-bing-264e560a">Block URLs option in Bing Webaster Tools</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1663419">Remove URLs option in Google Webmaster Tools</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Filter URLs option under the <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Advanced</a> tab. Note that this option should be used only if the other options aren't feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> Are specific web pages missing from your Bing web results? You can tell us about any missing URLs via an RSS feed or manually (the Supplemental Feed and Supplemental URLs options under the <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Advanced</a> tab, respectively). We'll fetch and index the pages and append them to your web results.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Activate Your Search by Adding Our Code Snippets to Your Website]]></title>
    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/code.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/code.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Activate Search > Code Snippets</p>

<p>Visit our <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>, select your site, and click on the Activate Search option in the left-hand menu.</p>

<p>Add the following two snippets of code to your website to "hook" your website and our hosted search service together. You can add this code to your individual web pages or to the template(s) in your content management system.</p>

<h2>1. Form Snippet</h2>

<p>Include this snippet of code where the form for your search box appears. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>2. Javascript Snippet</h2>

<p>Include this snippet of code before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. This tag enables type-ahead search in the search box on your web pages and powers the data on trending URLs on the <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Site Overview</a> page in the Admin Center. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
      var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };

      var script = document.createElement("script");
      script.type = "text/javascript";
      script.src = "http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
      document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);

//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Setting Up a Search Box for Specific Folders or Subdomains</h2>

<p>You can limit results to specific folders or subdomains by creating a collection, setting up an RSS feed, or passing in a hidden value.</p>

<h3>Collection</h3>

<p>Create a <a href="/manual/collections.html">collection</a>. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to <code>action="http://search.usa.gov/search/docs/</code> and (b) add an input for this collection, <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;</code>. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search/docs/" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The value is the number for your collection ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your collection in the Admin Center as shown in the sample below.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/get-code-collection.png" alt="Value for the collection ID" /></p>

<h3>RSS Feed</h3>

<p>Set up an <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feed</a>. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to <code>action="http://search.usa.gov/search/news/</code> and (b) add an input for this feed, <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###"&gt;</code>.  It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search/news/" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The value is the number for your RSS ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit or preview your feed in the Admin Center.</p>

<h3>Hidden Value</h3>

<p>Leave your domain blank on the <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> page and, instead, passing a hidden value for the domain in the search form code.</p>

<p>See, for example, <a href="http://www.ri.gov">RI.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.dmv.ri.gov/">DMV.RI.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.health.ri.gov/">Health.RI.gov</a>. On Health.RI.gov, the following hidden value is added to limit to only the health subdomain.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="site" value="www.health.ri.gov" &gt;
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> If your website is secured with https, you can add 's' to the two URLs above (i.e., <a href="https://search.usa.gov/search">https://search.usa.gov/search</a> and <a href="https://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js">https://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js</a>, respectively) so that searchers don't receive a security message in Internet Explorer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> If you're using Drupal, be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/USASearch">Drupal module</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> We offer <a href="/manual/cname.html">DNS masking</a>, which allows you to show searchers your domain (instead of USA.gov).</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A Punch List to Go Live with DigitalGov Search]]></title>
    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/go-live.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/go-live.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your pre-launch checklist will be unique to your agency's workflow, requirements, and deadlines. A typical punch list to go live with DigitalGov Search follows.</p>

<h2>Connect Your Site to DigitalGov Search</h2>

<p>Most agencies add these two <a href="/manual/code.html">snippets of code</a> to the template(s) in their content management systems (rather than adding them to individual pages).</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>1. Does your search box point to DigitalGov Search?</strong> Update your search box form code point to our service so that, when users execute a search, they'll see your DigitalGov Search-hosted results page.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;&lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;&lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>2. Do you have the our Javascript tag on your webpages?</strong> This Javascript powers the suggestions for type-ahead and <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">related searches</a>. It also provides data on your trending URLs on the <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Site Overview</a> page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
     var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };
    var script = document.createElement("script");
    script.type = "text/javascript";
    script.src = "http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
    document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Double Check Your Content Sources</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>3. Have you told us which domain(s) you want to search?</strong> List one or more <a href="/manual/domains.html">domains</a> that you want to search on the first page of web results. Most agencies opt to leave out the 'www' to include all subdomains (for example, list usa.gov to include answers.usa.gov, blog.usa.gov, publications.usa.gov, etc). Some agencies especially department-level portals opt to also include their bureaus' websites (for example, Commerce.gov includes commerce.gov, noaa.gov, trade.gov, etc.)</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>4. Have you told us about your RSS feeds?</strong> We love <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>. Tell us about all of your feeds, even if you opt not to show them (see #7 below). They're the quickest way for you to tell us about your new and updated content. Feeds also have well-structured titles, URLs, descriptions, and dates that we use to improve your search results page. (Tip: Preview your feeds from the RSS page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> to confirm that we've indexed your content.)</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>5. Have you told us about your social media accounts?</strong> <a href="/manual/flickr.html">Flickr photostreams</a>, <a href="/manual/twitter.html">tweets</a>, and <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube videos</a> are a great way to highlight your recent content. Tell us about all of your social media, even if you opt not to show them (see #7 below).</p>

<h2>Customize the Display of Your Search Results Page</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>6. Have you made the search results page look like your website?</strong> Customize the <a href="/manual/brand.html">brand</a> (font, colors, logo, favicon, and navigation links) of your search results page to create a seamless experience for users as they search and browse your website.</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>7. Have you told us what to show on your results page?</strong> Turn on (or off) the GovBoxes (that is, the inline results in the center of the page) and sidebar options (that is, the facets in the left-hand column) you want to appear on your search results. You can change the default settings on the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page in the Admin Center.</p>

<h2>Set Up Nice-to-Have Features (Optional)</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>8. Have you masked your domain?</strong> We offer <a href="/manual/cname.html">DNS masking</a>, which allows you to show searchers your search.YOURSITE.gov (instead of search.USA.gov). If you leverage DNS masking you will have to change your search box form action from search.usa.gov to search.YOURSITE.gov.</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>9. Have you added the Javascripts for your other third-party web services to your results page?</strong> If you have a <a href="/manual/third-party.html">third-party service</a> running on your website, you likely want it to run on your results page. Agencies often include their 4Q, AddThis, Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, or WebTrends code, among others.</p>

<h2>Don't Forget SEO (Optional)</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>10. Have you optimized your site so we can find your content?</strong> We follow <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/05/31/four-steps-to-achieve-good-seo/">search engine optimization</a> (SEO) best practices. Verify that you have a <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org">robots.txt</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and an <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org">XML sitemap</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. These two files are typically located in the root directory of your website (i.e., agency.gov/robots.txt and agency.gov/sitemap.xml, respectively). Also verify that your robots.txt file allows our user agent (usasearch) to access your public content.</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>11. Have you registered your site with the major commercial search engines?</strong> Register for both <a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster">Bing Webmaster Tools</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en">Google Webmaster Tools</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to maximize the coverage of your content in their search results.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/add-site.html"/>

    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/add-site.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > Add Site</p>

<h2>Homepage URL</h2>

<p>Tell us the homepage URL of your website. Enter a fully qualified URL, including http://, http://www, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Correct Syntax</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>http://www.whitehouse.gov</li>
<li>http://louisiana.gov</li>
<li>http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/</li>
<li>http://nimh.nih.gov/</li>
<li>http://www.ci.bloomington.mn.us/</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Incorrect Syntax</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>usa.gov (use http://www.usa.gov)</li>
<li>www.nasa.gov (use http://www.nasa.gov)</li>
<li>http://www.ftc.gov/opa/index.shtml (use the higher-level folder, http://www.ftc.gov/opa)</li>
<li>http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000?utm_source=OCM&amp;utm_medium=print-radio&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=shortcuts (use the higher-level domain, http://www.gsa.gov)</li>
<li>http://www.doc.gov (use the domain that resolves, http://www.commerce.gov)</li>
</ul>


<p>We use this homepage URL to (a) populate your primary <a href="/manual/domains.html">domain</a> and (b) link the default logo on your results page to your homepage.</p>

<h2>Display Name</h2>

<p>Tell us the name of your website. Searchers see your site name on the results page, such as in your page title or best bets. We recommend using the plain language name for your agency or site, such as National Institutes of Health.</p>

<h2>Site Handle</h2>

<p>We use your site handle in the HTTP request to specify displaying your customized settings. We recommend making this handle short and unique, such as nih.</p>

<p>Handles can have lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores only. They can't have spaces and other punctuation.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/settings.png" alt="Site name and handle on NIH.gov's search results page" /></p>

<h2>Site Language (Required)</h2>

<p>Choose a language for your site, English or Spanish. We will only index and provide results for pages in your selected language. All display text on the results page will also be in your selected language.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> Once you've added your site, edit your display name on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page. If you later need to edit your site handle or language, email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#115;&#x65;&#97;&#x72;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#46;&#100;&#105;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#x61;&#108;&#x67;&#111;&#x76;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#118;">&#115;&#x65;&#97;&#x72;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#116;&#x2e;&#100;&#105;&#103;&#x69;&#116;&#x61;&#108;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/site-overview.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/site-overview.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Dashboard > Site Overview</p>

<p>The Site Overview page provides a snapshot of what has been happening on your site in the past day or so.</p>

<p>You can also opt to receive this snapshot as a daily email by clicking on the envelope icon next to your selected site.</p>

<h2>Top Queries</h2>

<p>Reports on the top 10 searches done by searchers on your site. If you don't have any searches, you'll see a message that there aren't enough query data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.</p>

<p>Note that the data are processed to present "real" searches by humans (that is, the data are de-duped by IP address to remove bot traffic and other noise).</p>

<h2>Top Clicked URLs</h2>

<p>Reports on the top 10 pages that were clicked thru by searchers on your search results page. If you don't have any clicks, you'll see a message that there aren't enough click data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.</p>

<h2>Trending URLs</h2>

<p>If there are any pages that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing URLs that were <em>visited by users on your website</em>.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular pages on your website. Investigate why pages are trending, if the reason is not immediately apparent.</p>

<p>Note that you'll only see this list of trending URLs if you have our <a href="/manual/code.html">Javascript snippet</a> on your web pages. Data are updated every few minutes so this is near real-time information and you may see URLs come and go quickly.</p>

<h2>Trending Queries</h2>

<p>If there are any queries that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing search terms with the greatest <em>gain</em> between yesterday and today.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular terms. Create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete.</p>

<h2>Queries with No Results</h2>

<p>If there are any terms that returned no results, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 queries with no results.</p>

<p>For example, on one agency's website in October 2012, a dozen searches for <em>frostline</em> returned no results. The frost line&mdash;also known as depth of frost or freezing&mdash;is the depth to which the groundwater in soil is expected to freeze. The agency's pages on the topic referred to this concept as <em>depth of freezing</em>.</p>

<p>Use this alert about results data to help searchers find your content by adding a <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bet</a>, updating your existing web pages, or both.</p>

<h2>Top Queries with Low Click Thrus</h2>

<p>If there are any frequently searched terms that returned results but didn't result in a click at least 20% of the time, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 searches with low click thru rates.</p>

<p>Use this alert about low click thrus to identify issues with coverage. You may opt to create a <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bet: Text</a> or <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">Best Bet: Graphics</a>, add pages that may be missing from the results, or do both to improve recall. Or, you may opt to incorporate language from these popular search terms into your titles and descriptions to improve the relevance of results.</p>

<h2>This Month's Totals to Date</h2>

<p>Reports on the total number of queries and clicks for the present month-to-date. A click  is recorded each time a searcher clicks on a results link.</p>

<p>A graph of your site's total search queries over time is also presented to provide an overview of how your traffic has trended from the time your agency started using our service (but no further back than 2010). Hover over the trend line to see the total number of queries in previous months.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> The <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Report</a> gives a bird's-eye view of the number of <a href="/manual/queries.html">queries</a> and <a href="/manual/clicks.html">clicks</a> each month.</p>

    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/july-2013.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlight: Add a URL</h2>

<p>Are specific web pages missing from your Bing web results? Tell us about these pages and we'll append the pages to your web results. We offer two ways for you to tell us about the web pages that you want us to fetch and include in our web index.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a specific URL manually.</li>
<li>Use an RSS feed to manage your URLs.</li>
</ol>


<p>Go to Manage Content > <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> > <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Advanced</a>. Select Supplement URLs to add an individual URL or select Supplemental Feed to add multiple URLs via an RSS feed.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/Add_Supplemental_URL.png" alt="Add a Supplemental URL" /></p>

<p>We'll fetch the URLs you add and we'll index their metadata (title, description, and URL) <strong><em>plus the full text of the web page or document</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>For supplemental URLs, searchers now see a snippet from either the metadata (description field) or full document text (body field), depending on which field matches their search term.</li>
<li>You now see better error messages for supplemental URLs that we couldn't index.</li>
<li>You can now access https results from our <a href="/manual/api.html">Search API</a>.</li>
<li>You now see a clickable URL for system alerts posted in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</li>
<li>We rolled out the first pages our new, beta Admin Center&mdash;the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> and <a href="/manual/users.html">Manage Users</a> pages and their corresponding <a href="/manual/index.html">help files</a>.</li>
<li>Developers now see unique descriptions for CPSC items in the <a href="/developer/recalls.html">Recalls API</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We set up a new cloud server to host our list of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial <a href="http://govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/vocab/index.php">government URLs that aren't included in the .gov or .mil top-level domains</a> that are cataloged using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tematres/">TemaTres</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
<li>We moved the cached results for our commercial web indexes into a separate static cache subdirectory so that they (a) can be pruned at their own rate and (b) persist across production pushes.</li>
<li>We now use a persistent file for your header and footer CSS instead of generating it each time we load your results page.</li>
<li>We now return a 404 not found status code for static files that we don't have. We used to return a 406.</li>
<li>We now index <a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?organization_id=US-WA:CITY-SEATTLE">Seattle.gov jobs</a> in our <a href="/developer/jobs.html">Jobs API</a>.</li>
<li>We updated our <a href="/developer/index.html">API documentation</a> to highlight the primary data sources for each API.</li>
<li>We started collecting your feedback on our new, beta <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</li>
<li>We reviewed the click data for our related search results.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We improved our validation check for manually added supplemental URLs.</li>
<li>We fixed the message that you see after you upload an invalid RSS feed for the supplemental URLs so that it is more actionable.</li>
<li>We now escape special characters like apostrophes so that searchers don't see unescaped values within the snippets of supplemental URLs.</li>
<li>You can now add <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a> without the http:// or https:// prefix.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="overview"></a></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When you're buying and using products, safety comes first.</p>

<p>Six federal regulatory agencies issue recalls on <a href="http://www.recalls.gov">Recalls.gov</a>.</p>

<p>This Recalls API allows you to tap into a list of (1) drug and food safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.fda.gov">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA), <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/home">U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service</a> (UDSA FSIS), and <a href="http://www.FoodSafety.gov">FoodSafety.gov</a>; (2) car safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA); and (3) product safety recalls from the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> (CPSC).</p>

<p>This API is great for consumer safety websites or applications, news organizations, and websites or magazines targeted to specific audiences, such as parents.</p>

<p><a name="using-the-api"></a></p>

<h2>Using the API</h2>

<p>This Recalls API accepts a GET request.</p>

<p>Recalls are searchable by keyword, issuing agency, date, UPC code, vehicle-specific attributes, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>The base URL is http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?<strong>parameters</strong></p>

<p>Sample API requests follow.</p>

<p>All recalls<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?</a></p>

<p>All cribs<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs</a></p>

<p>All cribs that pose a choking hazard<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking</a></p>

<p>All cribs that pose a choking hazard sorted by date<br/>
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking&amp;sort=date">http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking&amp;sort=date</a></p>

<p><a name="parameters"></a></p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>Seven generic parameters are accepted.</p>

<ol>
<li>query</li>
<li>organization</li>
<li>start_date</li>
<li>end_date</li>
<li>page</li>
<li>per_page</li>
<li>sort</li>
</ol>


<p>There are additional parameters that are specific to food, product, and car safety recalls. None are required.</p>

<h3>query</h3>

<p>Attempts to extract as much "signal" as possible from the input text. Handles word variants, so a search on "choke" will find a recall categorized as a "choking" hazard.</p>

<h3>organization</h3>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The unemployment rate has hovered around 8 percent since early 2012. So, not surprisingly, many people are hitting the web to search for jobs.</p>

<p>Federal, state, and local government agencies are hiring and have thousands of job openings across the country.</p>

<p>This Jobs API allows you to tap into a list of current jobs openings with the government. Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>This API is great for job websites or applications, job banks, and career counseling and placement applications.</p>

<p><a name="using-the-api"></a></p>

<h2>Using the API</h2>

<p>This Jobs API accepts a GET request.</p>

<p>Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>The base URL is http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?<strong>parameters</strong></p>

<p>Sample API requests follow.</p>

<p>All nursing jobs
<a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=nursing+jobs</a></p>

<p><a name="parameters"></a></p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>Seven parameters are accepted.</p>

<ol>
<li>query</li>
<li>organization_id</li>
<li>hl (for highlighting)</li>
<li>size</li>
<li>from</li>
<li>tags</li>
<li>lat_lon</li>
</ol>


<h3>Query</h3>

<p>Attempts to extract as much "signal" as possible from the input text. Handles word variants, so a search on "nursing jobs" will find a job titled "nurse practitioner" and "RN." When parts of the query parameter are used to search against the position title, the results are ordered by relevance. When no query parameter is specified, they are ordered by date with the most recent listed first.  For generic jobs searches (e.g., 'jobs', 'internships') where the <strong>lat_lon</strong> parameter is passed in, the results will be sorted by distance to the searcher's geographic location.</p>

<p>Sample query formats follow.</p>

<h4>All jobs (by date or by proximity)</h4>

<ul>
<li>jobs</li>
<li>positions</li>
<li>vacancies</li>
<li>opportunities</li>
<li>postings</li>
</ul>


<h4>Location-based (by date)</h4>

<ul>
<li>jobs in fulton</li>
<li>jobs in fulton, md</li>
<li>jobs in fulton, maryland</li>
<li>jobs in md</li>
<li>pentagon jobs</li>
<li>jobs fayetteville</li>
<li>fayetteville nc jobs</li>
<li>jobs atlanta georgia</li>
</ul>


<h4>Agency-based (by date)</h4>

<ul>
<li>job opportunities at the cia</li>
<li>jobs at the treasury dept</li>
<li>tsa job openings</li>
<li>va jobs # will match jobs in Virginia</li>
</ul>


<h4>Keyword-based (by relevance)</h4>

<ul>
<li>nursing jobs</li>
<li>summer internship position</li>
</ul>


<h4>Schedule-based (by date)</h4>

<ul>
<li>part-time jobs</li>
<li>full-time positions</li>
</ul>


<h4>Combinations (by relevance)</h4>

<ul>
<li>part-time security guard job openings at the tsa in los angeles, ca</li>
</ul>


<h3>Organization_id</h3>

<p>Specifies which federal, state, or local agency to use as a filter.</p>

<p>For federal agencies, the ID is based on <a href="https://schemas.usajobs.gov/Enumerations/AgencySubElement.xml">USAJobs' agency schema</a>. Two letter codes are used to span entire departments, while four letter codes are generally used for independent agencies or agencies within a department.</p>

<p>For state and local agencies, a sample of the format follows.</p>

<p><em>State of Virginia</em>
US-VA</p>

<p><em>State of Virginia Department of Taxation</em>
US-VA:DEPT-TAX</p>

<p><em>Fairfax County, VA</em>
US-VA:COUNTY-FAIRFAX</p>

<p><em>Fairfax County Sheriff</em>
US-VA:COUNTY-FAIRFAX:SHERIFF</p>

<p><em>City of Fairfax, VA</em>
US-VA:COUNTY-FAIRFAX:CITY-FAIRFAX</p>

<p>If you specify an <code>organization_id</code> in your API call but the searcher types in another agency, the searchers' agency overrides the <code>organization_id</code> parameter. For example, VA jobs are returned when you specify Air Force jobs, but the searcher looks for jobs at the VA (<a href="http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=jobs+at+the+va&amp;organization_id=AF">http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=jobs+at+the+va&amp;organization_id=AF</a>).</p>

<h3>Hl [highlighting]</h3>

<p>No highlighting is included by default. Use 'hl=1' to highlight terms in the position title that match terms in the user's search. Highlighted terms are surrounded with <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<h3>Size</h3>

<p>Specifies how many results are returned (up to 100 at a time).</p>

<h3>From</h3>

<p>Specifies the starting record.</p>

<h3>Tags</h3>

<p>Specifies the level of government. Current tags are <code>federal</code>, <code>state</code>, <code>county</code>, and <code>city</code>.</p>

<h3>Lat_lon</h3>

<p>Comma-separated pair denoting the position of the searcher looking for a job. For example, 'lat_lon=37.783333,-122.416667' is the value for San Francisco, CA. For generic job searches (e.g., 'jobs', 'internships') where this parameter is passed in, the Jobs API server will sort jobs results and return those that are closest to the searcher's location. For jobs that have multiple locations associated with the position, the distance to the closest location is used to determine the overall geo-distance for the job. Note that for keyword-based job searches (e.g., 'jobs in NY', 'nursing jobs'), this parameter has no effect and is ignored.</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<p>We've tailored this Jobs API for our use in our search results. Data are normalized across government job listings and we don't include all jobs from all data sources. So, we encourage you to use the original data sources directly.</p>

<p>Federal government jobs are from <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov">USAJobs</a>. The USAJobs API for job opportunity announcements is at <a href="https://data.usajobs.gov/Rest">https://data.usajobs.gov/Rest</a>.</p>

<p>State and local government jobs are from cities, counties, and state agencies that use <a href="http://www.neogov.com">NeoGov</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, such <a href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/jobs-and-volunteer">jobs with the the city of Boulder, Colorado</a>.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/june-2013.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've spent the past few weeks doing some spring cleaning to improve our backend infrastructure and to lay the groundwork for a major update to our Admin Center. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We started using the Rails <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">asset pipeline</a>. As a result of using the pipeline and some of the other chores below, we decreased the page load time by 25 percent.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/0-90-1-released/">Elasticsearch 0.90.1</a>.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/05/14/ruby-2-0-0-p195-is-released/">Ruby 2.0.0</a>.</li>
<li>We updated the way we monitor <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/category/passenger/phusion-passenger-4/">Phusion Passenger</a>.</li>
<li>We removed some unused tables and columns from our MySQL database.</li>
<li>We removed the legacy recalls code from our codebase now that we've released it as a standalone open source <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls API Server</a>.</li>
<li>We no longer require a valid API key to include API queries in your <a href="/tagged/analytics">site analytics</a>.</li>
<li>We updated our list of synonyms to include fracking and hyrdofracturing as equivalent terms.</li>
<li>The hyperlinks in the Admin Center system alerts are now clickable.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed a regression bug with <a href="https://github.com/haml">Haml</a> and Ruby 2.0.0 that made the background color of the search results the same color as the page background.</li>
<li>We fixed the CSS for the magnifying glass on the search box so that it appears properly in IE7.</li>
<li>We now only show unique descriptions for <a href="http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search?organization=cpsc&amp;sort=date">CPSC recalls</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>1. Search Your Twitter Lists</h3>

<p>Does your agency have dozens of Twitter accounts? Do you have a public Twitter list for these accounts? You can now opt to <a href="/manual/twitter.html">index tweets</a> from your lists. You can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show tweets from your Twitter account only (for example, index and show tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/USDA">@USDA</a> only)</li>
<li>Show tweets from your account's public lists (for example, index and show tweets from the all members of @USDA's list, <a href="https://twitter.com/USDA/lists/usda-twitter-accounts">USDA Twitter accounts</a>).</li>
</ul>


<p>(Thanks, <a href="http://www.nih.gov">NIH.gov</a> team, for suggesting this new feature!)</p>

<h3>2. Search Your Multimedia Galleries</h3>

<p>Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery?</p>

<p>You can now opt to <a href="/manual/rss.html">index MRSS feeds</a> so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.</p>

<p>MRSS is the standard <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss">media RSS specification</a> for syndicating multimedia content. So, even if you don't have an MRSS feed now, it should be easy to generate one as long as your content is in a content management system or other database. MRSS is also the standard specification used by hosted multimedia services such as Flickr, Instagram, Vimeo, and YouTube.</p>

<p>Email us at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x73;&#101;&#97;&#x72;&#x63;&#104;&#x40;&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#x74;&#x2e;&#100;&#x69;&#103;&#105;&#x74;&#97;&#108;&#x67;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;">&#x73;&#101;&#x61;&#x72;&#99;&#x68;&#x40;&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#x72;&#x74;&#46;&#100;&#105;&#x67;&#x69;&#116;&#x61;&#108;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#118;</a> if you have any questions about how to set up an MRSS feed to index your multimedia content.</p>

<p>(Thanks, <a href="http://www.usgs.gov">USGS.gov</a> team, for suggesting this new feature!)</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>For each result, searchers now see the URL directly under the title. The order is now title-URL-description. It had previously been title-description-URL.</li>
<li>Searchers using screen readers now hear plain language labels for the search box&mdash;Enter your search term (English) and Ingrese su búsqueda (Spanish).</li>
<li>When searchers opt to allow us to use their location, they now see <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">jobs</a> that are geographically closest them.</li>
<li>Mobile searchers now see your site's display name as the alt tag for your mobile logo.</li>
<li>You can now access jobs data in our <a href="/manual/api.html">search API</a> so that, if you use our API, you can display jobs in your search results.</li>
<li>Searchers on Spanish-language websites now see the <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a> when they search on jobs-related terms. For example, a Jobs GovBox appears on GobiernoUSA.gov for a search on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=gobiernousa&amp;query=trabajos"><em>trabajos</em></a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We updated how we index and store <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>, including YouTube feeds, so that we index each feed only one time.</li>
<li>We now return a Bad Request message for <a href="/developer/recalls.html">recalls API</a> searches that specify a page greater than 20, which is <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api/commit/0539ce559cae7c4f9360f56dba91932bc48ebb4c">outside of the allowed range</a>.</li>
<li>When available, we now <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api/commit/74ff28198b2e09418d9d0826fffdcb99bd7fd22f">pull CPSC's URLs</a> for their recalls from their 301 or 302 response headers.</li>
<li>We now filter out federal jobs with more than 20 locations.</li>
<li>We removed the code for our forms feature on <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and federal forms API. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectMyUSA">@ProjectMyUSA</a> to see how the MyUSA team is working to improve the public's experience with federal forms.</li>
<li>We removed the code that created a separate mobile version of USA.gov. Visit  <a href="http://www.USA.gov">http://www.USA.gov</a> to see its new, responsive design.</li>
<li>We updated the cron script for our monthly analytics emails.</li>
<li>We updated our stemming file.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed the pagination in our <a href="/manual/api.html">search API</a> so that the API now consistently returns 10 results (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc).</li>
<li>We tweaked the Spanish translations for the <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">jobs GovBox</a>.</li>
<li>We fixed the link for the advanced search operators on the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?affiliate=gobiernousa">Spanish-language advanced search page</a> to point to the corresponding Spanish-language help.</li>
<li>We now correctly identify the Food and Drug Administration or Food Safety and Inspection Service as the data sources in our <a href="/developer/recalls.html">Recalls API</a>.</li>
<li>We fixed how we handle registered trademarks in the <a href="/developer/recalls.html">Recalls API</a> so that searchers can now find items such as Zicam&reg;.</li>
<li>We now provide a better response when an API call specifies the 'doc' index but doesn't include the required, complementary 'dc' parameter.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/march-2013.html"/>
    <updated>2013-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/march-2013.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighted Feature: Limiting Results to a Subset of Your Content</h2>

<p>Do you want to set up a search box (or even hundreds of search boxes) over a subset of your content?</p>

<p>You can set up a <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collection</a>. Or, you can now pass in a 'sitelimit' parameter to filter the results to specific folders or domains.</p>

<h3>Option 1. Set Up a Collection</h3>

<p>See the sample results page on <a href="http://www.nih.gov">NIH.gov</a> that shows results for a search on <a href="http://search.nih.gov/search/docs?affiliate=nih&amp;dc=565&amp;query=cancer"><em>cancer</em></a> in NIH.gov's New Releases.</p>

<p>Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to News in the left-hand menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/nih-collection.png" alt="Collection-based search results for cancer in NIH.gov news releases" /></p>

<h3>Option 2. Use the Sitelimit Parameter</h3>

<p>Compare the collection-based results above with the results for <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nih&amp;query=cancer&amp;sitelimit=nih.gov/news">the same search using the sitelimit parameter</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to nih.gov/news in a message under the search box, among other differences.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/nih-sitelimit.png" alt="Sitelimit-based search results for cancer in NIH.gov news releases" /></p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do you have information in the footer of your results page that searchers need to see? Searchers can now view or hide the footer while on your search results page. After clicking on the Show Footer icon located at the bottom right-hand corner of the search results page, searchers will see the footer. They'll still be able to scroll infinitely through the search results while the footer is visible. To hide the footer, they can click on the icon again.</li>
<li>Searchers' see job openings in their state <em>before</em> the listings for jobs in other states.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We automated the syncing of our geolocation data.</li>
<li>We published instructions for the <a href="/developer/jobs.html">Jobs API</a>.</li>
<li>We migrated our website platform from Tumblr to <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.</li>
<li>We set up a cron job to regenerate tagged pages after commits for our website.</li>
<li>We published an RSS feed for our website.</li>
<li>We added sequester/sequestration as an entry in our synonym file so that searchers looking for information on the topic find all relevant results.</li>
<li>We throttled the YouTube RSSFeedFetcher to avoid HTTP 403 errors.</li>
<li>We added some compound indexes to speed up queries.</li>
<li>We added JSONP support for the <a href="/developer/jobs.html">Jobs API</a> and <a href="/developer/recalls.html">Recalls API</a>.</li>
<li>We investigated additional sources for jobs openings, such as the Department of Labor's <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/DOL-SUMMERJOBS-SERVICE.htm">Summer Jobs</a> and the National Resource Directory's <a href="https://www.nrd.gov/home/api/veterans_job_search">Veterans Jobs Bank</a>.</li>
<li>We moved the publishing platform for USASearch.HowTo.gov from Tumblr to <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github pages</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers see a tool tip for the icon that toggles the display of the header and footer.</li>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/january-2013.html"/>
    <updated>2013-01-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/january-2013.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighted Feature: Jobs GovBox</h2>

<p>We're excited to announce that searchers looking for jobs on your site can now see all of your agency's current job openings.</p>

<p>Our new <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Job Openings GovBox</a> displays up to three location- and keyword-matched job openings on your results page. For more information on how to turn on this GovBox, see <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">How To Select The Modules That Appear On Your Results Page</a>.</p>

<p>We've open sourced all of the code that powers our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">Jobs Server API</a> in Github.</p>

<p>We analyzed data on jobs-related searches to ensure that the new federal <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a> lists the most relevant job openings.</p>

<p>Searchers can now effectively search for jobs by keyword, agency, state, or work schedule (part-or full-time).</p>

<p>We also focused on not showing the Jobs GovBox when it isn't relevant (for example, it is no longer shown when searchers look for job safety posters or employment verification forms).</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We added our posting channel ID to all USAJobs links.</li>
<li>We set up a cron job to fetch and process job files from USAJobs.</li>
<li>We added impression and click tracking for the Jobs GovBox module.</li>
<li>We resolved performance discrepancy between our <a href="/releases/october-2012.html">two datacenters</a>.</li>
<li>We no longer use XML sitemaps to add documents to our web index.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can now delete keywords from text best bets.</li>
<li>Newly added misspellings are now being applied to type-ahead suggestions.</li>
<li>Searchers can now find jobs in non-standard state locations (for example someone searching for jobs in Washington, DC, will find postings the the location of Washington DC Metro Area, District of Columbia).</li>
<li>We've already pushed two bug fixes for the Jobs GovBox to production. Searchers no longer see yet-to-be-opened or already closed jobs.</li>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/november-2012.html"/>
    <updated>2012-11-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/november-2012.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>1. Common Search Metrics for the Digital Strategy</h3>

<p>Do you ever feel like you're drowning in data? Do you feel like finding meaningful insights from the data is like searching for a needle in a haystack?</p>

<p>To standardize and streamline how agencies collect and report this data, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a> requires federal executive branch agencies to implement common performance and customer satisfaction metrics. DigitalGov has published <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/07/29/digital-metrics-for-federal-agencies/">guidance on common metrics</a>, including describing what you should measure, what to do with the data, and common tools to help you collect and analyze your metrics.</p>

<p>To support you in collecting and reporting your site <a href="/tagged/analytics">search metrics</a> for the Digital Government Strategy, we've added four new reports to the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Top "no results" queries.</strong> The most popular, valid searches that don't return any results on your site's search results page (e.g., because you don't have the content on your site, or the content isn't findable by the person's search term). Review your content to see if you need to add new content, or update existing content to include the words your readers search for.</li>
<li><strong>Top searches with low click through rates.</strong> The most popular search terms that people generally don't act (click) on. Consider incorporating language from these popular search terms into page titles or descriptions, to encourage searchers to click on your relevant page.</li>
<li><strong>Top changing search terms (movement up/down).</strong> Shows trending topics, what's hot or not. Use this report to investigate why people might be losing interest in once-popular content and consider archiving if it's no longer needed. For newly popular terms, create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete.</li>
<li><strong>Top clicked URLs for specific queries.</strong> The most common results that searchers found most relevant or appealing, for specific search terms. Review these popular pages and other customer top tasks to make sure they are current, accurate, complete and compelling.</li>
</ol>


<h3>2. Recommended Pages in Type-ahead Suggestions</h3>

<p>Searchers often know the exact page they're looking for. We've added a feature to help them find that page even more quickly.</p>

<p>As searchers type in their query, relevant <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">text Best Bets</a> are shown as Recommended Pages, as shown in the sample below for a search on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=jobs&amp;amp;affiliate=u.s.departmentoflabor"><em>fa&#8230;</em> on DOL.gov</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mdljlrljT71qid15q.png" alt="Type-ahead suggestions on DOL.gov's search results  page" /></p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers can narrow RSS news results by custom date ranges.</li>
<li>Searchers now see more images above the fold on image results pages.</li>
<li>Searchers see integrated image results across both the images on your website and in your Flickr photostream.</li>
<li>You can now add the <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digtital Analytics Program's</a> government-wide analytics tag to your search results pages. Email the Digital Analytics Program at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x44;&#x41;&#80;&#x40;&#103;&#x73;&#97;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;">&#68;&#x41;&#x50;&#x40;&#x67;&#x73;&#97;&#x2e;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;</a> for more information on setting up the government-wide analytics tag.</li>
<li>When you <a href="/manual/twitter.html">add your Twitter handle</a> in the Admin Center, we now show the Twitter GovBox by default.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We upgraded the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/tweetstream">tweetstream</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/twitter">twitter</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> gems.</li>
<li>We upgraded <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/cdh4-1-now-released/">Cloudera 4.1</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and installed <a href="https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/IMPALA10BETADOC/Cloudera+Impala+1.0+Beta+Documentation">Impala</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>

<li>We fixed a bug so that the query timeline chart now displays in all browsers.</li>
<li>We synced the Query Logs and Click Stats reports so that you now see today's data for both.</li>

    <updated>2012-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/october-2012.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Highlight: Upgraded Search Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Good news! We completed a major upgrade of our search infrastructure. You likely didn't notice as we completed the upgrade without any downtime for searchers on your site.</p>

<p>Our system is now even more secure, stable, and redundant than it was before. Plus, it is faster, too. Highlights of the upgrade follow.</p>

<p><strong>Multihoming.</strong> We've always had a disaster recovery, backup datacenter, but it often sat idle. We wanted to make better use of all of our servers so we're now leveraging a content delivery network to send traffic to whichever datacenter is geographically closest to the searcher. This allows us to use both datacenters equally and serve our results quickly.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mcd7tbK8RD1qid15q.png" alt="Multihomed" /></p>

<p><strong>New Hardware.</strong> We increased our RAM and CPU resources by five times. We have room to grow and to roll out more features.</p>

<p><strong>Upgraded Software.</strong> We're now on Red Hat 6 and Cloudera 4.</p>

<p><strong>Speed, Speed, Speed.</strong> We're always working to improve the speed of our search results. We changed some of our caching rules. We also started to leverage <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> (a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server).</p>

<h2>Other Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We removed the Hosted Sitemap feature.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>We added alerts to the Admin Center to communicate maintenance windows or other timely content with you.</li>
<li>Searchers can see keyword-scoped results for collections. If you have a collection below three folder levels deep, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a> and we'll help you set up a keyword for your collection.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We now show dates for RSS news items on each customer's search results page only.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug which caused highlighted terms on results pages to omit trailing spaces.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug on how "site:" operators retrieve results.</li>

    <updated>2012-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/september-2012.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>1. Infinite scrolling</h3>

<p>Searchers now have the benefit of infinite scrolling on your results pages. What is infinite scrolling? You've probably used it on many commercial websites, such as <a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=yosemite">Bing Images</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=yosemite">Duck Duck Go</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://pinterest.com/search/boards/?q=yosemite">Pinterest</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/yosemite">Twitter</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. It automatically allows searchers to see more results when they get to the bottom of the page, without clicking on the link for the next page of results.</p>

<p>Try it out on your site's search results page, or on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;amp;query=yosemite">USA.gov</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;amp;query=yosemite"><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_mb2awk8xwU1qid15q.png" alt="Infinite scroll on USA.gov's search results page" /></a></p>

<p>Infinite scrolling has many advantages, including:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Speed.</em> The next set of new results loads quicker than a totally new page.</li>
<li><em>Streamlining the user interface.</em> Studies show most searchers don't use the next page buttons. Proactively loading results allows searchers to see more results on one page and to compare them.</li>
<li><em>Simplifying the indexes.</em> When and how we display results from our various web indexes is easier for us, you, and end users.</li>
</ol>


<h3>2. Helping searchers find forms.</h3>

<p>Similar to our existing agency and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;amp;query=diabetes">health</a> GovBoxes, we created a forms GovBox to help searchers find federal government forms. So far, we've included forms from the Department of Defense, General Services Administration, Social Security Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>

<p>We've also published the forms data as a Federal Forms API for third-party developers.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>We completely revamped how <a href="/manual/collections.html">collections</a> work to provide you with more flexibility. We encourage you to check out this feature if you're interested in offering  navigation options in the left-hand sidebar on your results page. You can now create a collection:</li>
<li>Covering tens of thousands (or even millions) of web pages.</li>
<li>Covering domains that aren't part of your primary <a href="/manual/domains.html">domain</a> (i.e., that aren't shown on the main web results page).</li>
<li>Without needing to add our Javascript <a href="/manual/code.html">code snippet</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We upgraded our robots.txt parser to account for comments and varying cases.</li>
<li>We eliminated support for six <a href="/blog/legacy-domains.html">legacy domains</a> as part of the .gov web reform project.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed broken URLs for Best Bets image files.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug with our browser user agent so that Internet Explorer users no longer sometimes see a blank results page.</li>
<li>We fixed a CSS validation bug so you don't see an error message when editing your header or footer.</li>
<li>We updated a broken link for Explore Topics on m.USA.gov.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/legacy-domains.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the federal <a href="http://www.usa.gov/WebReform.shtml">.gov web reform</a> project, we're eliminating six of our legacy domains. Going forward, our only supported domain is search.usa.gov (or search.yoursite.gov, if you've requested <a href="/manual/cname.html">DNS masking</a>).</p>

<p>What do you need to do? If your URL starts with any of the following six legacy domains, you must update your HTML form code.</p>

<ol>
<li>firstgovsearch.gov</li>
<li>searchusa.gov</li>
<li>usasearch.gov</li>
<li>(Spanish) buscador.gov</li>
<li>(Spanish) buscadorusa.gov</li>
<li>(Spanish) usabuscador.gov</li>
</ol>


<p>Specifically, you have to update the action of your <a href="/manual/code.html">form code</a> to call search.usa.gov (or search.yoursite.gov).</p>

<p><code>&lt;form method="get" action="http://search.usa.gov/search"&gt;</code></p>

<p>Note that, if you don't update your form code, your search results page will no longer work.</p>

    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/releases/july-2012.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of your most frequently asked questions is, "What's your roadmap?" We decided to use the halfway point of the year to expand our release notes to include notes on our upcoming features.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Highlight: searchers see recent tweets when they search on your website</h3>

<p>We're now displaying Twitter results in the third rail. Searchers like Twitter results because they often contain your latest information. The third rail increases the  visibility of your tweets and it allows searchers to see both Twitter and YouTube results above the fold in the browser.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows social media results on Commerce.gov for a search on <em><a href="http://search.commerce.gov/search?query=innovation&amp;amp;affiliate=commerce.gov">innovation</a></em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_m71vk4FInR1qid15q.jpg"/></p>

<p>If you have a Twitter account, tell us the name of your profile and searchers will be able to find relevant, recent tweets when they search on your website.</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>. Select your site.</li>
<li>Click on the Social Media option. Enter the name of your Twitter account and click save.</li>
<li>Click on the Results Modules option and opt to show your tweets in a GovBox.</li>
</ol>


<p>Wait until you post your next tweet. Then, go to your website and do a search for a word or phrase in the tweet. You'll see it as a GovBox intermingled with your web results.</p>

<h2>Other features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Customers with lots of documents will have them indexed more quickly.</li>
<li>You may now enter multiple handles if you have more than one social media account for Flickr, Twitter, or YouTube.</li>
<li>Mobile searchers can see image results.</li>
<li>You may now see whether we've indexed your Twitter or Flickr content.</li>
<li>We now index Microsoft Office documents (Excel, Word, and PowerPoint).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Address memory bloat.</li>
<li>Searchers can no longer see multiple sidebar items selected.</li>
<li>Launch jumpstart index for newly added sites with a single site domain.</li>
<li>We now label Office documents.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue with Flickr indexing.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Our Roadmap</h2>

<h3>Coming Up in July</h3>

<p>We "celebrated" during the Fourth of July holiday by focusing on some general housekeeping to ensure stability for the rest of the year. We'll release new features to index secure (https) content. We'll also update our discovery tag to power both type-ahead and fetching (eliminating the need for you to have put two sets of javascript on your web pages).</p>

<h3>Coming Up Next Quarter</h3>

<p>We divide our roadmap into four categories, and we complete one major feature in each category per quarter.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Customer Services.</em> We plan to improve and facilitate our signup process. We're going to automatically populate more content when you add a site so it is easier for you to take advantage of new features. We also plan to create a dashboard to allow you to see what has changed within your search configuration.</li>
<li><em>Content Sources.</em> You've requested more control to divide search results into content sources, topics, etc. We plan to offer more flexibility to allow you to divide your content as it makes sense for your searchers.</li>
<li><em>Core Search.</em> One good (or bad) aspect about search is that there is always more work to do in terms of relevancy, speed, scaling, etc. We plan to focus on tuning these aspects, especially for our newer content sources.</li>
<li><em>Search Analytics.</em> We have a growing amount of data, and we want to expose more of it to you. In parallel with providing you just a dashboard in the Admin Center, we plan to proactively notify you of any potential issues.</li>
</ol>


<p>We hope that this glimpse into our recently released features and our short- and long-term roadmap helps you understand what we're working on and what's coming down the road.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>1. Customers Receive a Monthly Analytics Report</h3>

<p>Now it is easier than ever for you to glean insight from your search logs on what visitors are searching for&mdash;in their own words&mdash;on your site. On the first of each month, we'll now email you an analytics report. Hopefully, you  already received one on June 1.</p>

<h3>2. Flickr Image Search</h3>

<p>Do you have a Flickr photostream? Tell us the name of your photostream. Within minutes, searchers will be able to find relevant images from your Flickr photostream when they search on your website.</p>

<li>Customers may input third-party tracking (e.g., Google Analytics, WebTrends, Omniture, etc.) via a request form.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>After our migration of Commerce.gov to Drupal, we used the native search tool. However, after looking at the internal site search analytics, it was obvious visitors were not finding what they were looking for. [DigitalGov Search] integrated easily into our system and provided several new features. I appreciate the auto-fill and sort by source features and so do our visitors. Our analytics logs report a much higher percentage of searches resulting in what the visitor was looking for.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>The [DigitalGov Search] tool is awesome. It makes finding things on our website easier than ever. The results that come back are both quick and relevant. My favorite feature has to be Query Logs. What our users are looking for is now crystal clear, which makes my life way easier. It provides insight into what users want that is sometimes very hard to find. It also allows us to promote the correct content.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
For instance, for several months our most search terms were employment and jobs, so we created a Jobs page and put it right on our homepage. After that the search for those terms dropped dramatically, which means users no longer had to poke and search for Jobs/Employment information because it was right where it needed to be.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
I almost couldn't believe that this amazing service is free. It's easy to implement and full of useful features, which would normally cost us quite a lot and in this economy it's these types of services that help us save money.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DigitalGov Search (formerly USASearch) is the <a href="http://ctolabs.com/gsa-usasearch-wins-2011-government-big-data-solutions-award">winner of the 2011 Government Big Data Solutions Award</a>, announced at <a href="http://www.hadoopworld.com">Hadoop World</a> in New York City on November 8, 2011.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ctolabs.com/big-data-award">Big Data Award</a> was established to highlight innovative solutions and to facilitate the exchange of best practices, lessons learned, and creative ideas for addressing Big Data challenges. The Award judges saw DigitalGov Search as a great example of solving Big Data problems to improve government agility and to provide better service for less.</p>

<p>In line with the GSA's cost-saving "build once, use many times" paradigm, DigitalGov Search provides hosted search services for <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and hundreds of other government websites. This is done in a cost-effective way, especially for the agencies involved, which receive these services at no cost.</p>

<p>From the Award presentation:</p>

<blockquote><p>The GSA is to be congratulated for their mission-focused, citizen-centered, open approach to a big data challenge and a resulting solution that improves the experience of a broad swath of users of federal services. On behalf of our judges and the many citizens who use this capability on a daily basis we say thank you, and congratulations on this well deserved recognition.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>InformationWeek</em> yesterday <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/galleries/government/leadership/231600939">recognized 15 government agencies</a> for taking on ambitious IT initiatives in an effort to provide better services at a lower cost.</p>

<p>Former federal CIO Vivek Kundra talked often about the technology gap that separates government workers from private-sector employees. Federal, state, and local government agencies have many initiatives under way in an effort to close that gap.</p>

<p>They're employing cloud computing, software as a service, the Web, mobile technologies, and more to give government workers the tools they need to be more productive and to deliver public services more efficiently.</p>

<p>GSA's DigitalGov Search (formerly USASearch) was one of those honored by <em>InformationWeek</em> for making government services in English and in Spanish more accessible online with a revamped version of DigitalGov Search and its set of advanced search technologies for <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a>. Noted was our use of Microsoft's Bing Index, open source technologies such MySQL, Hadoop, and OpenCalais, and employing agile development to deliver new features quickly.</p>

<p>The award also cited our affiliate program which now includes hundreds of government websites that share our services and data through the platform. This affiliate program offers free search services to any federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government agency. Affiliates can create a customized search experience that best fits their clients' needs through a simple, online administrative console.</p>

    <link href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/adopting-hadoop.html"/>

    <id>http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/adopting-hadoop.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The United States federal government's DigitalGov Search program provides hosted search services for government affiliate organizations, shares APIs and web services, and operates the government's official search engine on <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a>. DigitalGov Search offers free search services to any federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government agency. Several hundred websites make use of this service, ranging from the smallest municipality to larger federal sites like <a href="http://www.weather.gov">http://www.weather.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.usa.gov">http://www.usa.gov</a>. DigitalGov Search leverages the Bing API as the basis for its web results and then augments the user search experience by providing a variety of government-centric information such as related search topics and highlighted editorial content. The entire system is comprised of a suite of open-source tools and resources, including Apache Solr/Lucene, OpenCalais, and Apache Hadoop. Of these, our usage of Hadoop is the most recent. We began using <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop/">Cloudera's Distribution including Apache Hadoop</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> (CDH3) for the first time in the Fall, and since then we've seen our usage grow every month&mdash;not just in scale, but in scope as well. But before highlighting everything DigitalGov Search is doing with Hadoop today, I should explain why we began using it in the first place.</p>

<h2>Phase 1: Search analytics</h2>

<p>All of the search and <a href="/manual/api.html">API</a> traffic across hundreds of affiliate sites, iPhone apps, and widgets comes through a single search service, and this generates a lot of data. To improve the service, administrators wanted to see aggregated information on what sorts of information searchers were looking for, how well they were finding it, what trends were forming, and so on. Once searches were initiated, they also wanted to know what results were shown and then what results were clicked on. They wanted to see all this information broken down by affiliate over time, and also aggregated across the entire affiliate landscape.</p>

<p>The initial system, like many initial systems, was fairly simple and did just enough to address our most pressing analytics needs. We took the logs from Apache and Ruby on Rails, put them in a big MySQL database on a separate machine, ran nightly and monthly jobs on them, and then exported the summary results to the main database cluster to be served up via a low-latency Rails web interface for analytics. We used a separate physical database machine with lots of memory and disk for the batch processing to keep our production MySQL instances from being impacted by this resource-intensive batch processing.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lle73iJ2Ts1qid15q.png" alt="Initial dataflow of raw logfiles to analytics apps" /></p>

<p>As we watched the main database tables grow and the nightly batch jobs take longer and longer, it became clear that we would soon exhaust the resources available on the single database analytics processing node. We looked at scaling up the hardware vertically and sharding the database horizontally, but both options seemed like we were just kicking the can down the road. Larger database hardware would be both costly and eventually insufficient for our needs, and sharding promised to take all the usual issues associated with a single database system (backups, master/slaves, schema management) and multiply them. We wanted the system to be able to grow cost effectively and without downtime, be naturally resilient to failures, and have backups handled sensibly. It was at this point that we started investigating HDFS, Hadoop, and Apache Hive.</p>

<p>HDFS offered us a distributed, resilient, and scalable filesystem while Hadoop promised to bring the work to where the data resided so we could make efficient use of local disk on multiple nodes. Hive, however, really pushed our decision in favor of a Hadoop-based system. Our data is just unstructured enough to make traditional RDBMS schemas a bit brittle and restrictive, but has enough structure to make a schema-less NoSQL system unnecessarily vague. Hive let us compromise between the two&mdash;it's sort of a "SomeSQL" system.</p>

<p>But best of all, we could layer the entire Cloudera stack on top of a subset of our existing production machines. By making use of each machine's excess reserve capacity of disk, CPU, and RAM, we were able to get a small proof-of-concept cluster stood up without purchasing any new hardware. The initial results confirmed that our workload lent itself well to distributed processing, as one job went from taking over an hour on a MySQL node to 20 minutes on a three machine Hadoop cluster. Within a week of getting the prototype up and running, we had transitioned all the remaining nightly analytics batch SQL jobs into Hive scripts. The job output fed into a collection of intermediate Hive tables, from which we generated summary data to export to MySQL as low-latency tables for the Rails web interface to use. To prove the scaling point, we spent five minutes adding another datanode/tasktracker to the mix, kicked off the cluster rebalancer, and the whole process ran faster the next day.</p>

<h2>Phase 2: Feedback loop</h2>

<p>The result of all this analysis in Hive shows up not just in various analytics dashboards, but as part of the search experience on many government websites, too. For example, compare the different type-ahead suggestions for '<strong>gran</strong>' on <a href="http://www.nps.gov">http://www.nps.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.usa.gov">http://www.usa.gov</a>. Both sites use the same DigitalGov Search backend system, but the suggestions differ completely. We use Hadoop to help us generate contextually relevant and timely search suggestions for hundreds of government sites like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lle73ymed31qid15q.png" alt="Different type-ahead suggestions on NPS.gov and USA.gov" /></p>

<h2>Phase 3: Internal monitoring</strong></h2>

<p>Shortly after moving our event stream analysis from MySQL to Hadoop/Hive, we noticed a change in how we thought about data. Freed from the constant anxiety of wondering how we were going to handle an ever-increasing amount of data, we shifted from trying to store only what we really needed to storing whatever we thought might be useful. We first turned our attention to the performance data emitted by the various sub-systems that make up the search program.</p>

<p>Each search results page is potentially made up of many data modules sintered together from calls to the Bing API, our own Solr indexes, a MySQL cluster, and a Redis cache. A small latency problem with any one of them can propagate through the system to create much larger problems, so we want to have a deep knowledge of how each subsystem behaves throughout the day under various circumstances. We were already monitoring the availability of all these services with Opsview, but we had no insight into their performance over time. Whenever we sensed a problem ("Is one of the Solr indexes getting slow?"), we would liberally apply ssh, tail -f, and grep to try to see what was going on. This seemed like a good use case for Hive, so in the case of Solr, for example, we threw the compressed log files into HDFS, wrote a simple SerDe regular expression to define rows in a Hive table partitioned by date, and built a view on top of that for easy manipulation of extracted columns such as the Solr index name and the hour of day. Hive makes it trivially easy to do some fairly sophisticated aggregate analysis on the response times for each Solr index, such as generating a distribution histogram, or calculating the pth percentile.</p>

<p>Some of these Hive queries are not run very often&mdash;perhaps just a few times a month&mdash;so we don't want to spend time building them into our test-driven Rails analytics framework. On the other hand, they are complex enough that we don't want to rewrite them every time we want to use them. For these cases, we use Beeswax in HUE to save off parameterized queries that can then be shared among engineers or analysts to run on an ad hoc basis.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the space of a few months, we've gone from having a brittle and hard-to-scale RDBMS-based analytics platform to a much more agile Hadoop-based system that was designed to scale intrinsically. We continue to see our Hadoop usage grow in scope with each new data source we add, and it's clear that we'll be relying on it more and more in the future as the suite of tools and resources around Hadoop grows and matures.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>When [DigitalGov Search] expanded their affiliate program, Broward County was fortunate to be the first County in the nation to participate in the effort. During times when budgets are limited, the partnership monetarily saved the County by not moving to a commercial search solution. As the program evolved to "new" technology and tools, the County and our visitors once again benefited from an ever-growing feature rich program that now offers a more accurate search with speed 9 times faster.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Thank you for a program that keeps on giving.</p></blockquote>
