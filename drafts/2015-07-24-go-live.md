## Decide What to Include in Your Search

<i class="icon-check"></i> **1. Have you told us which domain(s) you want to search?** List one or more [domains](/manual/domains.html) that you want searchers to start out searching in. Most agencies opt to leave off the 'www' to include all subdomains (for example, list just usa.gov to include answers.usa.gov, blog.usa.gov, publications.usa.gov, etc.). Some agencies, especially department-level portals, opt also to include their bureaus' websites. For example, the primary search on Commerce.gov includes commerce.gov, noaa.gov, trade.gov, etc. If you need to list more than a handful, [reach out to us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) to go over options for scoping your search.

<i class="icon-check"></i> **2. Have you told us about your RSS feeds?** We love [RSS feeds](/manual/rss.html). They're one of the quickest ways for us to index your new and updated content. Tell us about all your feeds, no matter how you opt to show them (see #5 below). Feeds also have well-structured titles, URLs, descriptions, and dates that we use to improve your search results page. (*Tip*: Preview your feeds from the RSS page in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) to confirm that we've indexed your content.)

<i class="icon-check"></i> **3. Have you told us about your social media accounts?** Most agencies publish content outside of their websites. [Flickr](/manual/flickr.html) and [Instagram](/manual/instagram.html) photos, [tweets](/manual/twitter.html), and [YouTube videos](/manual/youtube.html) can be included in your search results. Tell us about all of your social media, no matter how you opt to show them (see #5 below).

## Customize the Display of Your Search Results Page

<i class="icon-check"></i> **4. Have you made the search results page look like your website?** Customize the [brand](/manual/brand.html) (font, colors, logo, favicon, and navigation links) of your search results page to create a seamless experience for users as they search and browse your website.

<i class="icon-check"></i> **5. Have you told us what to show on your results page?** Turn on (or off) the options you want to appear in the body of your search results and as search facets in your navigation menu. You can change the settings on the [Display Overview](/manual/display-overview.html) page in the Admin Center.

## Connect Your Site to DigitalGov Search

Most agencies add the following two [snippets of code](/manual/code.html) to the template(s) in their websites or content management systems (rather than adding them to individual pages). These code snippets are customized to your search site and are provided in the Admin Center.

<i class="icon-check"></i> **6. Does your search box point to DigitalGov Search?** Update your search box form code to point to our service so that, when users execute a search, they'll see your DigitalGov Search-hosted results page.

```
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"><div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"><input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&#x2713;" /></div>

	<input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" />
	<label for="query">Enter Search Term(s):</label>
	<input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" />
	<input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" />
</form>
```

<i class="icon-check"></i> **7. Do you have our Javascript tag on your webpages?** This Javascript powers the suggestions for type-ahead searching and [related searches](/manual/display-overview.html). It also provides data on your trending URLs on the [Site Overview](/manual/site-overview.html) page in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/).

```
	<script type="text/javascript">
	//<![CDATA[
		var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };
	 	
	 	var script = document.createElement("script");
	 	script.type = "text/javascript";
	 	script.src = "http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
	 	document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
	//]]>
	</script>
```

## Set Up Nice-to-Have Features (Optional)

<i class="icon-check"></i> **8. Have you masked your domain?** We offer [DNS masking](/manual/cname.html), which allows you to show searchers `search.YOURSITE.gov` (instead of `search.USA.gov`). If you leverage DNS masking you will have to change your search box form action from `search.usa.gov` to `search.YOURSITE.gov`.

<i class="icon-check"></i> **9. Have you added the Javascripts for your other third-party web services to your results page?** If you have a [third-party service](/manual/third-party.html) running on your website, you likely want it to run on your results page. Agencies often include their Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, or WebTrends code, among others.

## Don't Forget SEO (Optional)

<i class="icon-check"></i> **10. Have you optimized your site so we can find your content?** We follow [search engine optimization](http://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/05/31/four-steps-to-achieve-good-seo/) (SEO) best practices. Verify that you have a [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org){% external_link %} and an [XML sitemap](http://www.sitemaps.org){% external_link %}. These two files must be located in the root directory of your website (i.e., `agency.gov/robots.txt` and `agency.gov/sitemap.xml`, respectively).

<i class="icon-check"></i> **11. Have you registered your site with the major commercial search engines?** Register for both [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster){% external_link %} and [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en){% external_link %} to maximize the coverage of your content in their search results.
