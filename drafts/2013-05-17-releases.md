## Highlight: Search Your Twitter Lists

Does your agency have dozens of Twitter accounts? Do you have a public Twitter list for these accounts? You can now opt to index tweets from your lists. You can either:

* Show tweets from your Twitter account only (for example, index and show tweets from [@NIHforHealth](https://twitter.com/NIHforHealth) only)
* Show tweets from your account's public lists (for example, index and show tweets from the all members of @NIHforHealth's list, [NIH Twitter feeds](https://twitter.com/NIHforHealth/nih-twitter-feeds)).

(Thanks, [NIH.gov](http://www.nih.gov) team, for suggesting this new feature!)

## Other Features

* Searchers on Spanish-language websites now see the [Jobs GovBox](/manual/govbox-jobs.html) when they search on jobs-related terms. For example, a Jobs GovBox appears on GobiernoUSA.gov for a search on [*trabajos*](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=gobiernousa&query=trabajos).

## Chores

* We updated the cron script for our monthly analytics emails to always send out reports for the past *month*, not past *day*.
* We added bombs, bomber, bombers, bombed, bombing, bombings => bomb to our stemming file.
* We removed the WebTrends code from our search results pages.

## Fixes

* We now correctly identify the Food and Drug Administration or Food Safety and Inspection Service as the source of the data in our [Recalls APi](/developer/recalls.html).
* We gracefully handle the error when an API query specifies 'index=doc' but doesn't include a 'dc' parameter.
