We often receive questions when an affiliate undergoes a major website upgrade, changes content management systems, or both. We created this checklist to share with you five steps to ensure your redesign is successful.

We strongly encourage you to publish the content of your new site as an API, pointing to our [indexing API, *i14y*](/developer/i14y.html). This will ensure that your site's search index is updated in real time as you publish, update, or delete content.

The following steps will facilitate faster re-indexing with commercial search engines.

1. Keep the file name and directory structure the same, if possible. If it isn't possible, use 301 redirects to send visitors to the appropriate new pages. For more on 301 redirects, read tips from [Bing](http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2011/10/06/managing-redirects-301s-302s-and-canonicals/){% external_link %} and [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633){% external_link %}. Notify other websites that link to you of the changes.
2. Register for the commercial search engines' webmaster tools.
    * [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster){% external_link %}
    * [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en){% external_link %}
3. Update the [XML sitemap](http://www.sitemaps.org){% external_link %} on your website and notify the search engines via the webmaster tools. Modern CMSs usually have a feature that will build an XML sitemap automatically.
	* Be sure your sitemap includes both the `<changefreq>` and `<updated>` tags. `<changefreq>` cues the search engines as to how frequently they should re-crawl your site, and `<updated>` lets them know if any changes have been made since the last indexing.
4. Notify the search engines of the content that has been removed via the webmaster tools. Specifically, in Bing, use the [Site Move tool](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/diagnostics/site/move){% external_link %} or the [Content Removal form](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/tools/content-removal){% external_link %} (no longer linked from within Bing Webmaster Tools).
5. Within the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/), update your [Domains](/manual/domains.html) and [RSS feeds](/manual/rss.html) to reflect your new design. If you have set up [Collections](/manual/collections.html), be sure to update the URLs there as well.

If you've undergone a redesign and are not using i14y, if you've followed these five steps, and your site search results are not what you'd expect, notify us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov>.
