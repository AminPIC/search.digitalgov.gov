We offer DNS masking, which allows you to show searchers `search.YOURSITE.gov` (instead of `search.USA.gov`). Follow these three steps to mask your domain.

1. Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> and ask us to mask your domain.
1. Create a CNAME in your external DNS records for `search.yoursite.gov`. Point it to `search.usa.gov.edgekey.net`. 
1. When the setup is complete, change the [code for your form](/manual/code.html) action from `search.usa.gov` to `search.yoursite.gov`.

By default, we set up `search.YOURSITE.gov` (such as `search.nih.gov`). If this subdomain is already used by another application, you can request `find.YOURSITE.gov` or `findit.YOURSITE.gov`.

To use a CNAME over HTTPS, your agency will need to provide the SSL certificate that we'd put on our infrastructure. Specifically:

1. Purchase
1. Renew
1. Validate with certificate authorities

You will also need to update your search form and javascript [codes](/manual/code.html) from `http` to `https`.

***Troubleshooting tip:*** Many agencies have both internal and external DNS. Be
sure to update your *external* DNS records (step 2) before changing your form code (step 3).

***Troubleshooting tip:***  Once the CNAME is set up, if visitors to your site happen to truncate the URL in the browser bar to `http://search.yoursite.gov` (without any parameters), they're automatically redirected to your homepage at `http://www.yoursite.gov`.
