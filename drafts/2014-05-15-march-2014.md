## Highlighted Features

### Feature 1. We have the hamburger menu!

This now ubiquitous icon will provide a solution for several use cases as we launch our new results page. 

The menu allows our customers to show as many facets, related sites, and web site navigation links as desired. Users now expect a hamburger menu to show additional operations and it works works well for search results pages. Why? most users click on a search result above the fold of the web page versus trying to browse or limit the results.
