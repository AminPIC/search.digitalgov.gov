# December Features

## Chores

* We fixed errors with URL shortening.
* We updated our stemming file so searchers no longer see irrelevant terms for intern, and looked into our stemming of top Spanish queries to add to our synonym list.
* We replaced Jenkins with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif).
* We aggregated two RSS urls into one feed.
* We fixed a time setting on API machine.
* We upgraded Java on API and [Cloudera](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/home.html)![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif).


## Fixes

* We fixed the layout of Best Bets Graphics so results are shown in vertical columns, newspaper style, and there are more spaces between links.
* We fixed a bug in Spanish language Best Bets Graphics and Spanish language searchers do not see spelling suggestions for terms with and without diacritics.
* We updated mobile search results to only show a more/less symbol when applicable.
* We renamed the IP deduped column <i>Real Count (Humans Only)</i> and changed zero to appear as n/a within Analyticsâ€™ downloadable CSV file.
* We fixed an issue with commercial results appearing on search engine results pages.
* We fixed mobile search so searchers can easily remove previous queries from the search box and long mobile search terms do not overlap with the 'x' on the right.
* We fixed Best Bets so they appear even when there are no web results.
* We fixed Best bets Graphics on mobile search so results appear clearly.
