## Facets

A *facet* is a way to refine a search, like looking at something through a particular narrow view. In DigitalGov Search, facets refine based on [Collections](/manual/collections.html), [RSS feeds](/manual/rss.html), or [image/video content](/manual/content-overview.html). In the desktop view, facets display in a top navigation bar. On smaller screens, they are available as a section of the menu. The navigation bar and menu section will only appear after you turn one or more facets on.

**Label.** (Smaller screens only) By default, we use the section label 'Search' for your facets. Enter a label in the label field if you'd like something other than this default. Keep your label consistent with the options you're listing and under 15 characters.

See for example on a mobile phone, this search that shows facets in the menu with the default label, Search, displayed for a [search on *passport* on USA.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&query=passport).

**On/off options for facets.** Select which facets you'd like to appear on your results page. Turn an option *On* to allow searchers to see it. Turn an option on or off at any time.

The default label for the primary search results facet is ‘Everything.’ To change this or any other facet’s display name, type over the text in the Name field. Keep each name short (15 or fewer characters) and consistent with the content you're searching. Click on the hyperlink in the Source field to update the facet's source content. To change the order, drag up or down the icon on the left with three horizontal lines.

**More.** (Desktop view only) We show up to four facets above your search box, including one for the default search results. If you turn on the display of more than three additional facets, you'll see them listed under a 'More' dropdown menu.  Email us at search@support.digitalgov.gov if you'd like to use a custom label instead of the default 'More'.


## Modules

In DigitalGov Search, a module is an index that can be added to your Domains search to provide a more robust search experience for your site’s visitors.

**On/off options for modules.** Turn modules *On* to allow searchers to see results for selected content sources in the body of the search results page based on keyword matches with relevant queries. Some modules are also available as search facets (see above).

There are eight types of modules.

1. **News.** This option only appears after you've told us about your [RSS](/manual/rss.html) feeds. When a searcher's query matches the title or description of an RSS article published within the last year, the article appears in the News module. Up to three articles are displayed. Type over the default name, News, in the Name field to edit the display name.

1. **Videos.** This option only appears after you've told us about your [YouTube](/manual/youtube.html) channel. When a searcher's query matches the metadata of a video published within the 13 months, the video appears in the Videos module. One inline video is displayed with a link to see more videos for the searcher's query.

1. **Job openings.** When a searcher's query matches the text of a job opening published by your agency on USAJobs or NeoGov, the job appears in the Job Openings module. Up to three job openings are displayed. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post [Help Searchers Find Jobs](/manual/govbox-jobs.html).

1. ***Federal Register* documents.** When a searcher's query matches the text of a notice or rule published by your agency in the *Federal Register*, the document appears in the *Federal Register* module. Up to three documents are displayed. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post [Help Searchers Find Federal Register Documents](/manual/govbox-federal-register.html).

1. **Related searches.** Help visitors better define the focus of their search by offering them searches related to their current search term. Suggestions are derived from the searches performed on your website. Up to five searches related to your visitors' original search are displayed and are updated in near real time. See, for example, the sample results page below that shows related searches displayed for a [search on *tacoma* on Access Washington](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=accesswashington&query=tacoma).

1. **Health topics.** Help searchers find high-quality, authoritative health information from MedlinePlus and ClinicalTrials.gov. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post [Help Searchers Find Health Information](/manual/govbox-health.html).

1. **Recent tweets.** This option only appears after you've told us about your [Twitter](/manual/twitter.html) account. When a searcher's query matches the text of a tweet published within the past three days, the tweet appears in the Recent Tweets module.

1. **Type-ahead search.** Help searchers refine their query by displaying type-ahead search suggestions as a list in the search box. The list forms as a searcher begins to type in the search box. Suggestions are listed in order of most popular (that is, most searched). They're updated every few seconds. See, for example, the suggestions appear as you type "di" on [SocialSecurity.gov's search results page](http://search.socialsecurity.gov/search?affiliate=ssa&query=names).

## Related Sites

Help visitors find content relevant to their search query that resides on other websites, such as the site for your parent organization or your Spanish-language site. When searchers click on the link to the related site, they see search results for their query on the related site.

Enter the [site handle](/manual/settings.html) for one of your other DigitalGov Search sites. Enter the text you'd like searchers to see for the link to the related site. Create two entries, one from the current site to the related site and vice versa, if you'd like a reciprocal link.

See, for example, the Español option displayed on [USA.gov for a search on *venezuela*](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=venezuela&affiliate=usagov). When searchers click this option, they see results for [*venezuela* on GobiernoUSA.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=venezuela&affiliate=gobiernousa).

If you list more than two related sites, searchers will see them listed under a dropdown menu, View Topic. See, for example, the related sites displayed on [Broward.org for a search on *jobs*](http://search.broward.org/search?affiliate=co.broward.fl.us&query=jobs).

Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> if you'd like to use a custom label instead of the default 'View Topic' label.

## Pointer to Kick Off New Search

Your site's visitors sometimes don't realize the scope of the content they're searching against. This is especially true when you set up a search box for a subsection of your site only or when you have separate options for searching your web pages and databases.

See, for example, the custom messages on IRS.gov's Forms & Pubs beta search encouraging visitors to try their search again to see tax materials for prior years.

* [Custom message on IRS.gov's Forms & Pubs beta search when there aren't any results](http://find.irs.gov/search?affiliate=irs-fp&query=no-results-message)
* [Custom message when there are results](http://find.irs.gov/search?affiliate=irs-fp&query=2014+form+1040)

Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> if you'd provide searchers with a custom message to encourage them to search another section of your site, your database, or both.

***Did you know?***  Searchers may narrow results by time period for any [RSS](/manual/rss.html) feeds. See, for example, results for a [search on *jobs* narrowed to press articles in the last week on WhiteHouse.gov](http://search.whitehouse.gov/search/news?affiliate=wh&channel=6&m=false&query=jobs&tbs=w).

***Did you know?***  For any of your [RSS](/manual/rss.html) feeds that you've extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/){% external_link %} property, searchers may narrow results by the three facets. We'll display "Contributor," "Publisher," and "Subject" as the default names. Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> to if you want to customize these display names.

***Did you know?*** You can also add the type-ahead search suggestions to your homepage, or wherever you have a search box on your website, by adding our [JavaScript snippet](/manual/code.html) before the closing `<body>` tag on your HTML web pages.
