We offer DNS masking, which allows you to show searchers search.YOURSITE.gov (instead of search.USA.gov). Follow these three steps to mask your domain.

1. Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> and ask us to mask your domain.
2. Create a CNAME in your external DNS records for *search.yoursite.gov*. Point it to *search.usa.gov.edgekey.net*. 
3. When the setup is complete, change the [code for your form](/manual/code.html) action from *search.usa.gov* to *search.yoursite.gov*.

If you would like to use DNS masking over https, your agency will provide the SSL certificate (purchasing, renewing, validating with certificate authorities) that we will put on our infrastructure.

***Troubleshooting tip:*** Many agencies have both internal and external DNS. Be
sure to update your *external* DNS records (step 2) before changing your form code (step 3).

***Troubleshooting tip:***  Once the CNAME is set up, if visitors to your site happen to truncate the URL in the browser bar to http://search.yoursite.gov (without any parameters), they're automatically redirected to your homepage at http://www.yoursite.gov. 

***Did you know?*** By default, we set up search.YOURSITE.gov (such as search.nih.gov). If this subdomain is already used by another application, you can request find.YOURSITE.gov (such as find.usda.gov) or findit.YOURSITE.gov.
