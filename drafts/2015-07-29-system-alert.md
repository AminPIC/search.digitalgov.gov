There may be times when you want to add a system alert to your search results page. For instance, during a [site redesign](/blog/redesign.html), you may wish to inform searchers that your site is in transition. 

Use the Custom Alert feature to add a text message to your search results page, which will appear at all times above all search results, regardless of the query. Enter the text for the alert, and hit Save to turn on your alert. At this time, the appearance of the alert is not customizable.
