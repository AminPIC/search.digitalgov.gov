## Font

Select your preferred font family.

## Colors

Select a predefined theme by clicking on its radio button. Customize a theme by clicking on its 'Customize' button.

Customize the color of any page element by clicking on the color picker text field. Enter a valid three- or six-digit hex value or pick a color by dragging the cross-hair icon inside the color picker window. Drag the triangle icon to control the color saturation. When you are done, click anywhere outside the color picker window.

## Borders
