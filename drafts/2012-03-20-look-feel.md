## Page Title

The default page title is *{Query} - {SiteName} Search Results*. This title includes parameters for the searcher's query term and the site name you provide on the <a href="/sites/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites). 

You can change the default page title by deleting the text and entering your preferred title.

See the sample results page below for a search for *everglades* on Broward County's <a href="http://www.broward.org">website</a>.

## Favicon

## Theme

Select a predefined theme by clicking on its radio button. Customize a theme by clicking on its 'Customize' button.

Customize the color of any page element by clicking on the color picker text field.

When you are done, click anywhere outside the color picker window.

## Background Image

Use the Browse... option to upload the logo or image that you'd like to appear in the background of your page, if any. Click on the option, Mark page background image for deletion, to delete an uploaded image.

Use the drop-down menu to select a repeat option.

* not repeat
* repeat (both horizontally and vertically)
* repeat-x (horizontally, left to right)
