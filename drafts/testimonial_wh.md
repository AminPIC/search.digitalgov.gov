##The White House

###We encourage the use of shared services across government agencies and we want to make WhiteHouse.gov an example for others to follow. It would not be possible to match the value of GSA's free search service by procuring or building a custom solution. Previously, we needed to dedicate significant resources to configuring and tuning our internal solution, whereas with USASearch, we can now deploy these resources to enhance the features of and technology supporting the White House website.
