    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p><strong>This is a preliminary announcement for a soon-to-be-posted job as a Search Analyst on the DigitalGov Search Team, General Services Administration (GSA).</strong></p>

<p>Do you have a passion for search and helping the public find good, relevant search results? Do you enjoy being part of a small, innovative team? If so, apply for the position working on DigitalGov Search, GSA's award-winning hosted service that powers the search box on 1,500 government websites.</p>

<p>The job announcement will appear on <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov">USAJOBS.gov</a> in April. The position is in the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies at GSA in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. It will be posted as an IT Specialist, GS-2210-11/12.</p>

<p>We're looking for an enthusiastic, talented person to help support DigitalGov Search. The position will support efforts to develop, maintain, and improve DigitalGov Search. It will focus on understanding information access and retrieval, especially search, to guide the information architecture, user interface, and policy decisions that enhance searchers' experience on sites that use DigitalGov Search. It will also focus on designing and implementing processes to ensure that our agency customers have the best possible experience with our service.</p>

<p>The announcement will be posted for 10 business days. This brief posting period is because of the federal government's interest in accelerating the hiring process and shouldn't be interpreted as an indication that someone has already been selected.</p>

<p>About Us: We're a commercial-grade service that gives the public a great search experience on government websites. With about 20 million searches each month, we power the search box on some of the most visited government websites, including NASA.gov, SocialSecurity.gov, USA.gov, USCIS.gov, WhiteHouse.gov, and 12 states' websites. It's so easy to take for granted. You go to a website, enter a term in the search box, and find the results you're looking for. But imagine the cost and time involved if every government agency and website had to acquire and run its own search engine. We take that burden off agencies' hands. By using free or low-cost commercial APIs and open source software, we currently provide the service free to any federal, state, or local agency.</p>

<p>We're posting this pre-announcement so you can spread the word to anyone who might be interested.  As soon as the job announcement opens, we'll update this post with a direct link to it so that interested persons can apply.  Contact Ammie Farraj Feijoo, DigitalGov Search Manager, at ammie[dot]farrajfeijoo[at]gsa[dot]gov for further information about the position.</p>

      <p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Display > Display Overview</p>

<h2>Sidebar (Faceted Navigation)</h2>

<p><strong>Label for Sidebar.</strong> Determine if you want to include a heading for your navigation options. If you want a heading, type your label in the label field. Keep your label short (15 or fewer characters) and consistent with the options you're listing. If you don't want a heading, leave the label field blank.</p>

<ul>
<li>Without heading&mdash;See the sample results page below that shows the navigation options without a heading displayed for a <a href="http://search.whitehouse.gov/search?affiliate=wh&amp;query=jobs">search on <em>jobs</em> on WhiteHouse.gov</a>.</li>
<li>With heading&mdash;See the sample results page below that shows the navigation options with a heading, labeled Search, displayed for a <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=passport">search on <em>passport</em> on USA.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>On/off options for sidebar.</strong> Select which navigation options you'd like to appear in the left-hand sidebar on your results page. Turn an option on to allow searchers to see it. You may choose at any time to turn an option on or off.</p>

<p>You can type over the text in the Name field to edit an option's display name. Keep each name short (15 or fewer characters) and consistent with the content you're searching. Click on the hyperlink in the Source field to update the option's source content. Hover over the icon with three horizontal lines on the left to change the order.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>

<p><strong>On/off options for Modules.</strong> Turn on a module to allow searchers to see inline, contextually relevant results for selected content sources based on keyword matches with relevant queries. There are eight types of modules.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>News.</strong> This option only appears after you've told us about your <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds. When a searcher's query matches the title or description of an RSS article published within the last year, the article appears in the News GovBox. Up to three articles are displayed. Type over the default name, News, in the Name field to edit the display name.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Videos.</strong> This option only appears after you've told us about your <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube</a> channel. When a searcher's query matches the metadata of a video published within the last year, the video appears in the Videos GovBox. Up to four videos are displayed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Photos.</strong> This option only appears after you've told us about your <a href="/manual/flickr.html">Flickr</a> photostream. When a searcher's query matches the metadata of a photo published any time, the photo appears in the Photos GovBox. Up to five photos are displayed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Job openings.</strong> When a searcher's query matches the text of a job opening published on USAJobs or NeoGov, the job appears in the Job Openings GovBox. Up to three job openings are displayed. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Help Searchers Find Jobs</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Related searches.</strong> Help visitors better define the focus of their search by offering them searches related to their current search term. Suggestions are derived from the searches performed on your website. Up to five searches related to your visitors' original search are displayed and are updated in near real time. See, for example, the sample results page below that shows related searches displayed for a <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=accesswashington&amp;query=tacoma">search on <em>tacoma</em> on Access Washington</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health topics.</strong> Help searchers find high-quality, authoritative health information from MedlinePlus and ClinicalTrials.gov. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-health.html">Help Searchers Find Health Information</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recent tweets.</strong> This option only appears after you've told us about your <a href="/manual/twitter.html">Twitter</a> account. When a searcher's query matches the text of a tweet published within the last three months, the tweet appears in the Recent Tweets GovBox. Up to three tweets are displayed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type-ahead search.</strong> Help searchers refine their query by displaying type-ahead search suggestions as a list in the search box. The list forms as a searcher begins to type in the search box. Suggestions are listed in order of most popular (that is, most searched). They're updated every 15 minutes. See, for example, the suggestions as you type di... on <a href="http://search.socialsecurity.gov/search?affiliate=ssa&amp;query=names">SocialSecurity.gov's search results page</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Related Sites</h2>

<p>Help visitors find content relevant to their search query that resides on other websites, such as the site for your parent organization or your Spanish-language site. When searchers click on the link to the related site, they see search results for their query on the related site.</p>

<p>Enter the <a href="/manual/settings.html">site handle</a> for one of your other DigitalGov Search sites. Enter the text you'd like searchers to see for the link to the related site. Create two entries, one from the first site to the second and vice versa, if you'd like a reciprocal link.</p>

<p>See, for example, <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=venezuela&amp;affiliate=usagov">a link to GobiernoUSA.gov displayed on USA.gov for a search on <em>venezuela</em></a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong>  Searchers may narrow results by time period for any <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds. See, for example, results for a <a href="http://search.whitehouse.gov/search/news?affiliate=wh&amp;channel=6&amp;m=false&amp;query=jobs&amp;tbs=w">search on <em>jobs</em> narrowed to press articles in the last week on WhiteHouse.gov</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong>  For any of your <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds that you've extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> property, searchers may narrow results by the three facets. We'll display "Contributor," "Publisher," and "Subject" as the default names. Email us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x73;&#x65;&#x61;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#x73;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#x2e;&#100;&#105;&#x67;&#x69;&#x74;&#97;&#108;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;">&#115;&#x65;&#97;&#x72;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#46;&#x64;&#105;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#x61;&#108;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#x76;</a> to if you want to customize these display names.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can also add the type-ahead search suggestions to your homepage, or wherever you have a search box on your website, by adding our <a href="/manual/code.html">JavaScript snippet</a> before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag on your HTML web pages.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<p>Over the past few weeks, we finished a long list of summer chores and we're happy to have a clear deck to offer you more features in the coming months.</p>

<p>We upgraded our environment to <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/1/20/rails-3-2-0-faster-dev-mode-routing-explain-queries-tagged-logger-store">Rails 3.2</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. This upgrade ensures continued stability and allows us to maintain our record of exceeding our service level agreements.</p>

<p>We also changed our back-end logic for indexing your content. We now index secure (https) content. We also now allow you to give instructions to our user agent in your <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">robots.txt</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> file.</p>

<p>Don't forget to check out your July search stats&mdash;in your email inbox or via the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Chores</h2>

<ul>

    <h1>
      <a href="/blog/open-source.html">Our Open Source Strategy</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>We keep an eye on on our what our government counterparts are up to, both in the U.S. and other countries. We recently came across <a href="https://www.gov.uk">Gov.UK's</a> philosophy on and approach to <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open">coding in the open</a>. It caught our attention and we realized we should also articulate our open source strategy.</p>

<h2>Use and Contribute to Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>Since 2010, we've embraced and leveraged open source software to build our site search service for federal, state, and local government websites. This use of open source has allowed us to experience enormous growth over the past few years. In March 2013 alone, over 24 million searchers received results from our service&mdash;a four-fold increase since March 2010.</p>

<p>Our search service is now a complex system made up of many moving parts, including providing type-ahead search suggestions, serving search results, fetching, indexing, and caching content, and providing analytics.</p>

<p>Each of these parts is compiled into our codebase and, as we use open source components for our system, we contribute back to the projects.</p>

<h2>Code in the Open</h2>

<p>We recently began to unravel our monolithic codebase so that we can share individual pieces of our code. To borrow the phrase from Gov.UK, we're now <strong><em>coding in the open</em></strong>.</p>

<p>We recently released the code for our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">Jobs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls</a> API servers. They're our first foray into coding in the open. The source code for these API servers is in <a href="https://github.com/GSA">our GitHub repo</a> and is available for anyone to see and contribute to.</p>

<p>The data products for this code are also open and available for anyone to consume on our <a href="/developer/index.html">Developer hub</a>.</p>

<p>These two servers and their underlying data now operate outside of our core search codebase.</p>

<p>Following this same model, moving forward, we plan to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Share first&mdash;For every new feature, we'll write the code so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the code, not just us. If the public community contributes to the codebase, we'll be able to improve this feature without taxing our developers.</p></li>
<li><p>Expose APIs&mdash;We'll expose our data products as APIs so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the data, not just searchers on a government websites.</p></li>
<li><p>Be our own customer&mdash;We'll use our own public code and data just like everyone else. We'll call our own API servers to integrate the data within our search results pages.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Make Things Open to Make Things Better</h2>

<p>We agree with Gov.UK that "to make things open makes things better."</p>

<p>We have finite resources and we don't want to lose our focus on serving our agency customers and improving visitors' search experience on government websites. So, we won't be spending a lot of time to build or support a vibrant community around our code.</p>

<p>That said, we hope that exposing the pieces of our system will be useful to someone somewhere. We'll continue to provide the "ingredients" of our search service so that others will be able to make use of the code and data in ways that we could never imagine.</p>

<h2>And, We're Not Alone</h2>

<p>We're not alone. Other federal agencies have embraced the approach of coding in the open and have <a href="http://gsa.github.io/federal-open-source-repos">GitHub repos</a>. Below are a just a few of our many favorites.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="http://www.cfpb.gov">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> has embraced open source, including serving their public data sets through <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/qu">qu</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> recently released the code for their <a href="https://github.com/usagov/usagov-ios-app">iPhone app</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> was in the forefront of using open source software in the federal government with their use of Drupal. They're continuing to lead by example by opening up the code for their <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions">We the People petitions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-ios">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-android">Android</a> mobile apps.</p></li>
</ul>

      <a href="/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html">I Didn't Try to Grow a Bigger Ox:  How I Found Hadoop</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>A year ago I rolled my first Hadoop system into production. Since then, I've spoken to quite a few people who are eager to try Hadoop themselves in order to solve their own big data problems. Despite having similar backgrounds and data problems, few of these people have sunk their teeth into Hadoop. When I go to Hadoop Meetups in San Francisco, I often meet new people who are evaluating Hadoop and have yet to launch a cluster. Based on my own background and experience, I have some ideas on why this is the case.</p>

<p>I studied computer science in school and have worked on a wide variety of computer systems in my career, with a lot of focus on server-side Java. I learned a bit about building distributed systems and working with large amounts of data when I built a pay-per-click (PPC) ad network in 2004. The system is still in operation and at one point was handling several thousand searches per second. As the sole technical resource on the system, I had to educate myself very quickly about how to scale up.</p>

<p>As I contemplated how doomed I would be should traffic levels increase much more, I remember wondering to myself, "How does Google deal with all that data?" The answer came to me in the form of the Google File System (GFS) paper and later the MapReduce paper, both from Google. It dawned on me that because Google was forced to solve a much larger problem, they had come up with an elegant solution for a whole range of more modest data problems running on commodity hardware. But it wouldn't be until 2010 that I would get to work with this technology firsthand.</p>

<p>As I wrote in an <a href="/blog/adopting-hadoop.html">earlier article</a>, I started re-architecting DigitalGov Search, the U.S. government's search system, in 2009 based on a solution stack of free, open source software including Ruby on Rails, Solr, and MySQL. A wave of déja vu hit me as I started worrying about what to do with the growing mountain of data piling up in MySQL and our increasing need to analyze it in different ways. I had heard that a new company called Cloudera, founded by some big data people from Yahoo!, Google, and Facebook, was making Hadoop available for the masses in a reliable distribution, much in the same way that RedHat did for Linux. Curiosity got the best of me and I bought the newly minted <em>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</em> from O'Reilly. The most insightful part of the book to me was the very first sentence. It's a quote from Grace Hopper: "In pioneer days, they used oxen for heavy pulling, and when one ox couldn't budge a log, they didn't try to grow a bigger ox." I didn't want to grow a bigger server; I wanted to harness a bunch of small servers together to work in unison. The more I learned the more curious I got, so I started reading more. And that's when I hit my first roadblock.</p>

<p>I think people who have been working with Hadoop technologies for years and years sometimes forget just how rich and diverse the big data software ecosystem has become, and how daunting it can be to folks approaching it for the first time. When people at the Meetups say they are evaluating solutions to their data scaling problem, the answers they hear sound something like this: "Just use Hadoop Hive Pig Mahout Avro HBase Cassandra Oozie Sqoop Flume ZooKeeper Cascading NoSQL RCFile. Oh, almost forgot…cloud."</p>

<p>The thought of wading through all of that just to learn about what I needed to learn about was a bit too overwhelming for me, so I put the whole matter aside for a few months. Over time, I started to dive into each of these projects to understand the primary use case, how active the developer community was and which organizations were using it in production. I converged on the idea of using Hive as a warehouse for our data. I opted for Cloudera's distribution since I wanted to reduce the risk of running into compatibility issues between all the various subsystems. Having tracked down anomalies in a highly multi-threaded and contentious distributed Java system before, I liked the idea of someone else taking on that problem for me.</p>

<p>At some point, I had read everything I could read and grew impatient to get my hands dirty, so I decided to just download CDH3 on my laptop and give it a try. The tutorial instructions for the standalone version worked, and I successfully computed more digits of pi than I ever thought I'd need. After creating some sample data in Hive and running a few queries, I felt pretty confident that Hive would be the right tool for the job. I just needed to find somewhere to install and run HDFS (namenode, secondary namenode, and data nodes), Hadoop (jobtracker and tasktracker nodes), Hive, and Hue for a nice front end to it all.</p>

<p>I knew from my past experience how to stretch the limits of CPU, disk, IO, and memory on commodity servers, and I identified a few potential servers at our primary datacenter with resources I figured I could leverage. Once again I followed the tutorial instructions, this time for the fully distributed version of CDH3, and once again I started to compute pi. And that's when I hit my second roadblock. It took me a few days to figure out that I had a problem with DNS. Each machine needs to be able to resolve every other machine's name and IP in the cluster. Whether you do that via /etc/hosts or a local DNS server is up to you, but it needs to happen or the whole thing gets wedged. Once I got that sorted out, everything just started falling into place and I had Hive working in production within a few days. A week later, I started pulling out the MySQL jobs and deleting big tables, and that's been the trend ever since.</p>

<p>Over time, I've gone on to learn about using custom Ruby mappers in Hive, moving data back and forth between MySQL and Hive with Sqoop, and getting the data into HDFS in real-time with Flume. All of these components from the Cloudera distribution are working nicely in our production environment now, and I sleep well at night knowing I have such a solid, deliberate plan for growth. My initial investment in learning about the Hadoop ecosystem is really paying dividends, but when I think about all those people at the Meetups stuck in evaluation mode, I feel their pain. Does it have to be such a struggle?</p>

<p>The big challenge in my opinion is not that any one piece of the puzzle is too difficult. Any reasonably smart (or in my case stubborn) engineer can set themselves on the task of learning about a new technology once they know that it needs to be learned. The challenge with the Hadoop ecosystem is that it presents the newbie with the meta-problem of figuring out which of these tools are appropriate for their use case at all, and whether or not to even consider the problem today versus deferring it until later. In a way Facebook has it easy, because when you are adding 15TB of data per day, that decision is pretty much made for you.</p>

<p>For all the companies sitting in the twilight between the gigabyte and the petabyte who don't have Hadoop expertise in-house, there is a collection of free information to help guide people to the right solution space (Hadoop Tutorial, White Papers). These days, when I talk to people who are evaluating solutions to their big data problems, my advice to them is to break down their problems into a few discrete use cases and then work on ferreting out the technologies that are designed for that use case. Get a proof of concept to demonstrate that the technology can address your use case and convince yourself and others that you're on the right track. Work toward putting something simple into production. Lather, rinse, and repeat. I am still in that cycle myself, as these days I'm exploring HBase and OpenTSDB to give me low-latency access to time series data and Mahout to do frequent item set mining, but that's another article for another day.</p>

      <a href="/blog/byoi.html">Pilot Program: Bring Your Own Index</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <h2>About the Pilot</h2>

<p>In 2013, we asked you for feedback about DigitalGov Search and other programs in GSA's <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729">Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies</a>. Many of you responded to our customer experience survey.</p>

<p>We learned that, in these times of tight budgets, you value our service being free. We also heard you loud and clear that you'd like to choose which search results you use&mdash;from Bing, Google, or some other source.</p>

<p>So, based on your feedback, we now have a pilot program that allows you to bring your own index (BYOI). This helps us make sure we continue to provide you the best, most cost-effective service possible and gives you the choice you want.</p>

<p>You can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a feed (typically from your database or content management system).</li>
<li>Provide access to a search index you already have from a commercial provider.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to Participate</h2>

<p>Since this is still a pilot, the setup is manual. Email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#115;&#x65;&#x61;&#x72;&#x63;&#104;&#64;&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#46;&#100;&#105;&#x67;&#105;&#x74;&#97;&#x6c;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;">&#115;&#101;&#97;&#x72;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#x73;&#x75;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#46;&#100;&#105;&#103;&#x69;&#116;&#x61;&#108;&#103;&#111;&#x76;&#x2e;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;</a> to let us know you're interested in participating in the pilot.</p>

<h2>Option 1. Provide an RSS Feed</h2>

<p>You'll have to set up two RSS feeds.</p>

<ol>
<li>Seed feed&mdash;a one-time, full RSS feed that provides us all of your content.</li>
<li>Change feed&mdash;an incremental feed that tells us about deltas (new, updated, or deleted content) only.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you want full text search, provide the full text of your page in the feed's description. If you want a more precise, metadata search, provide a short snippet about your page in the feed's description.</p>

<p>As long as you create structured feeds, we'll index your content. It doesn't matter what  underlying technology system you use. Below are a few good references to get you started for two of the more common CMS, but don't let these links confuse you if you already have a feed generation system in place.</p>

<p><strong>Drupal</strong> has a few ways to export content as a structured feed, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/83597">RSS Feeds for Views</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i></li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/feeds">Feeds (module to export your entire site)</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i></li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/node_export">Node Export</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>WordPress</strong> provides detailed overview of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds">how to handle its feeds</a>.&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i></p>

<h2>Option 2. Provide a Search Index</h2>

<p>We can leverage almost any search index directly. For each web search, we'll send a searcher's query to your chosen search index, and we'll render the results within our search results page.</p>

<h3>Google Search Appliance</h3>

<p>If you already have (or plan to purchase), a Google Search Appliance, we can accept the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search-appliance/documentation/614/xml_reference#results_xml">XML output</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> from your appliance. You'll be responsible for managing the number of documents indexed as this affects the cost of the appliance (such as $x for up to x documents).</p>

<p>See GSAAdvantage for options to <a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/search.do?q=0:2google+search+appliance">purchase a Google Search Appliance</a>.</p>

<h3>Google Site Search</h3>

<p>If you already have (or plan to purchase), Google Site Search, we can accept your <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview">API key</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. You'll be responsible for managing traffic levels as this affects the cost (such as $x per 1,000 queries).</p>

<p>See GSAAdvantage for options to <a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/search.do?q=0:2google+site+search">purchase Google Site Search</a>.</p>

<h3>Other Search Indexes</h3>

<p>Most search indexes expose their results as XML. If you have another search index that renders XML, let us know and we'll work with you to determine if it will work within our system.</p>

<p>Do you want your search results page to run web services such as 4Q, AddThis, Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, Siteimprove, or WebTrends?</p>

<p>Input the JavaScript code you'd like to call from your search results page. Click submit to send us your request. We'll input your code for you and send you an email to confirm that we've done it.</p>

<p>Some tips for commonly used third party web services follow.</p>

<h2>Google Analytics Tip</h2>

<p>In your Google Analytics JavaScript, be sure to set your domain if you've requested <a href="/manual/cname.html">domain masking</a> and you want to include your search subdomain (e.g., search.commerce.gov) with your main domain (e.g., commerce.gov).</p>

<pre><code>_gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'commerce.gov']);
</code></pre>

<p>For more information, read Google's tip, <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite">Tracking Multiple Domains</a>.</p>

<p>The code you submit should look something like one of the following two scripts.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics Code (Older Format)</h3>

<pre><code> &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 var _gaq = _gaq || []; 
 _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-########-1']); 
 _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

 (function() { 
 var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; 
 ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl'; : 'http://www') +      '.google-analytics.com/ga.js'; 
 var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s); 
 })();

 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Google Analytics Code (Newer Format)</h3>

<pre><code>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
</code></pre>

<h2>Digital Analytics Program Tip</h2>

<p>Does your federal agency participate in the <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> (DAP)?  You don't need to do anything. We're already fully integrated with DAP.</p>

<h2>ForeSee Tip</h2>

<p>Coordinate with your ForeSee representative and DigitalGov Search to implement your customer satisfaction survey on your results page. The four general steps follow.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#115;&#x65;&#97;&#x72;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#x73;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#46;&#x64;&#x69;&#x67;&#x69;&#116;&#97;&#108;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#118;">&#x73;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#x63;&#104;&#x40;&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x2e;&#x64;&#105;&#103;&#105;&#x74;&#97;&#108;&#x67;&#111;&#x76;&#x2e;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;</a> to <a href="/manual/cname.html">set up a CNAME</a> for search.youragency.gov.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the files path in your Foresee code to use an absolute path instead of a relative path.</p>

<p> <strong>Find =></strong> 'files': '/fsrscripts/',</p>

<p> <strong>and replace it with =></strong> 'files': '//www.youragency.gov/fsrscripts/',</p>

<p> <em>(Or, find => 'files': '/foresee/', and replace it with => 'files': '//www.youragency/foresee/',)</em></p>

<p> in the following five files.</p>

<ul>
<li>foresee-trigger.js</li>
<li>foresee-tracker.js</li>
<li>foresee-alive.js</li>
<li>foresee-qualifier.js</li>
<li>foresee-test.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Submit your foresee-trigger.js via our Admin Center. It should look something like the following.</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.youragency.gov/library/foresee/foresee-trigger.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>We'll send you an email to confirm that we've set up both your CNAME and added the script for your foresee-trigger.js file.</p></li>
</ol>
