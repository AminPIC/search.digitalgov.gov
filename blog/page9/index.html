    <div class='post-content'>
      <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some scholars have alleged that possibly Shakespeare, writing the above for his play Romeo and Juliet, was also slyly poking fun at the latrine-challenged rival theatre, The Rose, across the road from The Globe. There can be multiple intentions behind using a particular word, and the word itself may have several meanings, synonyms, and spelling variations.</p>
<p>In our query logs, for example, we have noticed that the term <em>immigration </em>has been misspelled with at least 20 variations, including: imagration, imegration, imergration,  imgration, imigation, imiigration, immagration, and so forth. </p>
<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a> is the federal government portal for the whole country. We are serving people of different ages, different levels of education, different linguistic backgrounds, and people who may type hastily or just badly. We want people to have a good search experience, if we can help them figure out where they want to go with their queries.</p>
<p>Even if their 4th grade soccer coach was more bedazzling than their 4th grade spelling teacher, we don’t want our users bogged down at the beginning of their search with a spelling mistake if we can help them. Our goal is to get you to relevant results with as few detours as possible.  So, we have added several features to help the public navigate smoothly through a misspelled search query and on to a good search results page.</p>
<p>One feature we employ is a spell checker which detects possibly misspelled words by using a background dictionary to compare search words to.</p>
<p><img class="img-polaroid" class="img-polaroid" alt="Spelling override option for a search on imegration" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lpzfhhhH4b1qid15q.png"/></p>
<p>Notice in the above example that users are still allowed to tweak the contents of the search results and insist on just the results for <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=imegration"><em>imegration</em></a> if they want to.</p>
<p>Spell checkers have evolved over the years from concluding that a word that isn’t in the background dictionary must be a misspelling and then arbitrarily adjusting the search results presented, to allowing the possibility that the search query is actually correctly formed. Having a spell checker blunder in and correct something that isn’t incorrect can cause frustration if users find themselves in a fruitless loop of logical idiocy. For instance, <em>solr</em> is a common misspelling of <em>solar</em>, but it is also the name of an open-source search server.  The public can now override unhelpful spell checker guesses.</p>
<p>Another way of helping the public navigate from misspellings to the form of a word that will go to good results is type-ahead search. This feature suggests topics in a drop down box as the public types in the search box. Type-ahead search suggests popular queries for aspects of a topic, but also gently reroutes the public to the correct spelling of a word.</p>
<p><img class="img-polaroid" class="img-polaroid" alt="Type-ahead suggestion correcting the spelling of mortgage" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lpzfe9O7cl1qid15q.png"/></p>
<p><em>Morgage</em> is a very common misspelling of <em>mortgage</em>. Once the public types in most of the misspelled word, the editorially managed type-ahead search presents the correct spelling of the word, and then the most popular searches for <em>mortgage</em>.  Users can quickly browse the list and select what looks right. This is designed to present the public with the most likely search term which will then provide quick navigation to good search results. Users can also ignore the type-ahead search list, finish typing their own search query, and then click on Search and go to the results.</p>

      <p>One of the primary goals of <a href="http://search.usa.gov/program">USASearch</a> is to offer government agencies a free search service through its <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">Affiliate Program</a> so that they can reach their own goal of sharing their agency’s resources and information with the public.<br/><br/>In a recent online discussion, USASearch was praised by the <a href="http://www.doi.gov">Dept. of the Interior</a>’s <a href="http://www.bia.gov">Indian Affairs</a> for offering some critically important services. Indian Affairs (IA), established in 1824, is the oldest bureau of the Dept. of the Interior. The agency provides services to 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives.<br/><br/>About the advantages of using USASearch over other possibilities as their search service, Indian Affairs IT specialist Stanley Smith advised an online questioner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest advantage is the Terms of Service. That, coupled with USASearch’s solid support and neat preview search results ability, are the reasons why we chose to go with USASearch. I would add that USASearch can customize the footer of the search results page as well. Also, they have analytics that are built-in. Analytics have been a really helpful tool that comes with USASearch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Smith!  We appreciate your allowing us to share your positive opinion that the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">USASearch Affiliate Program</a> is a good choice for government agencies.</p>

      <p>There is a lot of editorial work behind the scenes in any portal, and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a> is no exception.  Sometimes human eyes are needed in processes where you wouldn’t think it would matter. One area we are always working to improve is our index of state and local sites. &#8220;Just crawl the web,&#8221; you might say.  Well yes, Bing, our web index provider, supplies us with many thousands of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial websites with <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=.gov">.gov</a> and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=.mil">.mil</a> domains, but that doesn&#8217;t cover anywhere near what is out there or what people might be looking for.</p>
<p>For one thing, a lot of local county/city/township sites have .com domains because it used to be, quite a long time ago, that the .gov domain was reserved strictly for federal agencies.  So there are a lot of .com and .org local government sites, and we want to include them in our index.  We want people to know where they can pay their local water bill online as well as where to e-file their federal tax return.   But most .coms are commercial sites, for businesses and entrepreneurs.  They are good places to go for certain kinds of services and products we all use. I personally buy 90% of what I use online, including groceries, but these commercial sites are not from the government. And it is government information and services that <a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a> is dedicated to providing. So we look for government sites that are .coms. We work from lists of local jurisdictions using .com domains we find or that some of our <a href="https://search.usa.gov/affiliates">affiliates</a> submit.  And bless our state portals which are often wonderful, complete sources of up-to-date lists of cities and counties in the state.</p>
<p>In the end, even as we work to process these programmatically, an editor still has to look at many, many of these sites to see if they really are governmental and if the URL is still valid.   What do we look for to conclude we have a useful, valid, government site?  Well, I look for sites that are clearly labeled, e.g. the &#8220;Official Site of Sunken Terrace Heights Township&#8221;, and is a source for:</p>
<ul><li>Transactions that can be performed online such as paying the water bill or a traffic ticket.</li>
<li>Community information such as meeting notices, agendas, and minutes. </li>
<li>City ordinances. </li>
<li>Contacts of officials and emergency numbers. </li>
<li>Services such as when the trash is picked up or where the schools are. </li>
<li>Citizen feedback such as local opinion surveys on this or that regulation being considered. </li>
</ul><p>Not every site will offer all of the above, but good local sites always have some of them. These are the ones we want to be sure to have indexed in our own portal.</p>

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>Many years ago I worked for an organization that decided to have its employees work a few overtime hours a week to categorize the internet by subject.  That would be the whole internet, all of it.  We figured we could get this done in maybe six months.  After all, there were nearly a half dozen of us willing to work a couple of nights a week, until summer anyway.</p>
<p>Even 20 years ago this goal was no longer attainable.  The project died from despair in the awful realization that something very big and out of manual control was going on &#8220;out there&#8221;.   The good news is that I finally had the money to paint my house.  I went on to work for a second organization that tried to do something similar, using three times as many people.  It didn’t work there either, although I did get the money to plant some really pretty flowers in my front yard.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a>, we have identified several specific search results problems that still exist:</p>
<ul><li>Content gaps due to poor relevancy or poorly organized organic search engine results.</li>
<li>Content gaps due to high interest news stories or to national emergencies for which content is too recently developed to have been crawled.</li>
<li>Content gaps due to the content not being available to the crawler, because it is too far down in the domain or too poorly described to be found.</li>
</ul><p>One way we editorially intervene is to boost contents to the top of the search results page.  This means we identify high interest queries that initially lead to poor search results, and we place relevant results above the organic web results.  We may boost single URLs or collections.</p>
<p>We sometimes choose one link to head the search results page.  It is a link that goes directly to a website.  There may be more than one link for a query, as shown below for a search on <em>FAA extension</em>.</p>
<p><img class="img-polaroid" class="img-polaroid" alt="Image of boosted URLs for search on FAA extension" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lprsj6Zt6D1qid15q.png"/></p>
<p>When we boost single URLs, they appear in a slightly color-delineated box and labeled &#8220;Recommended by USA.gov&#8221;.  They are not expected to stay up long. They may be switched out for new content as a news story or a national emergency develops. Often the content plucked to be boosted soon becomes a stable item high in the search engine results, and there is no longer a need to boost that site.</p>
<p>Collections of boosted URLs consist of a group of topically related sites organized into a display and placed at the top of the search page, as shown below for a search on <em>tornadoes</em>. These collections are put up to address the same problems as single URLs, but may stay up longer.  They may go up and down seasonally, such as for holidays or special events, or may stay up a while to bring together sites that remain in demand.</p>
<p><img class="img-polaroid" class="img-polaroid" alt="Image of boosted collection for search on tornadoes" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lprtutmUGc1qid15q.jpg"/></p>
<p>Once the organic results, or other editorially programmed features, provide a good search experience, then the hand-edited collections will be taken down.</p>
