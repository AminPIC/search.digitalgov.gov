    <p>What do &#8220;turkducken&#8221;, &#8220;thunder thighs dinosaur&#8221;, and &#8220;Goldilocks zone&#8221; have in common?  They have all been searches that have briefly trended upwards. As users were searching for content on these topics, the phrases rose in popularity and then fell. So, all these phrases have been search trends.</p>


<p>To determine what is trending, we go to our search query logs and we monitor published trends lists on other sites. Search query logs can tell us what’s on the minds, in the aggregate, of the visitors to our website. Trends lists published on other websites broaden our view and can confirm what we suspect.</p>


<p>Interests will change over time. </p>


<p>A few years ago, interest in turducken recipes trended upwards. The next year thousands of cooks at Thanksgiving wanted to brine their turkeys. The following Thanksgiving, searchers wanted to know how to fry a whole turkey in a vat of boiling oil.</p>


<p>Several years ago, the only hurricanes searched on <a href="http://www.usa.gov/">USA.gov</a> were the Atlantic hurricanes heading towards the U.S. east coast, or the Gulf States. Recently more Pacific hurricanes have been searched, as well as hurricanes far from the continental U.S. Monitoring our search logs alerts us to when we need to provide different navigation to content.</p>


<p>Search trends also tell us which aspects of a topic people want to know about and when they want to know.  For instance, there is a pattern to hurricane searches that goes something like this:</p>


<ul><li>Where is that hurricane I heard about? (“hurricane forming”)</li>
<li>Uh-oh, is it headed towards me? (“hurricane tracking”)</li>
<li>Looks like I am going to get hit, what do I do to prepare? (“hurricane disaster kit”)</li>
<li>What are my local emergency services telling me to do? (“hurricane evacuation”)</li>
<li>Where can I go that is safe? (“hurricane shelter”)</li>
<li>The hurricane has passed, but I need help. (“federal agencies that help natural disaster victim”)</li>
</ul>


<p>Knowing the natural timeline of aspects of a topic helps us program to those aspects in the right sequence. It also helps provide content for the editorial features we post on the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/">USA.gov</a> search results page, which we update using the Best Bets feature in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Affiliate Center</a>.</p>


<p>Watching when searches trend also lets us know when interest is building in a seemingly minor topic, something we might not intuitively know. As the economy has gotten tough for so many people, searches for “foreclosed homes” have risen, but so have searches for “foreclosed homes for sale”.</p>


<p>The search numbers for the Cash for Clunkers program rose immediately and precipitously, letting us know early that this seemingly modest economic stimulus had caught on with the public. And I was surprised when I noticed, a few years back, that people were consistently searching for Christmas ornaments in July and children’s Halloween costumes in August. These were not trends I would have predicted based on my own habits around Christmas or Halloween.</p>


<p>When analyzing the logs for query trends, we have to pay attention to how people search.  I didn&#8217;t realize that searches for the Code of Federal Regulations were so high until I discovered that people search for specific parts, e.g. “10 cfr 1045”.  Adding them all up gave me a better idea of the popularity of the Code.</p>


<p>We also need to know how the public spells some terms, e.g. Channukah or Hannuka or what something is popularly called.  I once discovered that were at least 17 different misspellings for the term &#8220;genealogy&#8221;.  And the government used “H1N1”, but people searched for “swine flu”.</p>


<p>It is only by aggregating all the searches for variant spellings, names, and aspects that we can get a true picture of the scope, and the trend, of a topic.</p>


<p>And finally, always keep in mind that checking the logs and relevant sources is much more efficient than trying to guess what’s on people’s minds. You probably can&#8217;t think of all the variations of a topic, but your users, in aggregate, will.</p>
