      <p>USASearch improved the quality of NC.gov&#8217;s search results 1000-fold. Results are relevant, helpful, and reliable. Setting up the site search is easy, and the instructions for including the search box on a website are clear and easy—including search that must cross many domains. Customer service is superb. I would recommend USASearch to any government agency.</p>

      <p>After our migration of Commerce.gov to Drupal, we used the native search tool. However, after looking at the internal site search analytics, it was obvious visitors were not finding what they were looking for. USASearch integrated easily into our system and provided several new features. I appreciate the auto-fill and sort by source features and so do our visitors. Our analytics logs report a much higher percentage of searches resulting in what the visitor was looking for.</p>

      <p>The primary mission of the Defense Media Activity (DMA) is to provide a broad range of high quality multimedia products and services to inform, educate, and entertain Department of Defense audiences around the world. DMA Public Web delivers information to a worldwide audience via 500+ official Department of Defense websites such as the official websites for Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force, Marines, Navy, and Army Corps of Engineers. </p>




<p>Our goal is to do that using the latest technologies available in the most cost effective manner possible. Partnering with USASearch has enabled us to further enhance our capabilities while saving upwards of $214,000 per year from our previous enterprise search system.</p>




<p>USASearch has empowered us with more control over search results to more effectively help our customers quickly and easily find the information they are looking for. Their flexible system allows us to make adjustments with ease and quickly deploy search for new sites, two elements that are crucial to the success of our operations. </p>




<p>Beyond that, we feel that USASearch values their stakeholders and we appreciate their flexibility, attention to detail, and migration assistance. They have been in constant contact with our team, and have adjusted their code numerous times to meet our core mission requirements with nothing less than superlative and reliable results. This program is a terrific example of how government agencies are finding new and creative ways to save money while still providing a much needed service.</p>

      <p>Last year the Department of Labor (DOL) participated in the <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/usability/first-fridays">First Fridays</a> Product Testing Program, a “discount” usability testing session designed to find and fix usability problems on <a href="http://www.dol.gov">DOL.gov</a>.</p>


<p>The experience led the DOL web team to <a href="http://social.dol.gov/blog/improving-our-website/">improve DOL.gov</a>, including changing their search engine.</p>


<p>So it was satisfying to learn that they decided to use USASearch to power the search on DOL.gov.  The basis of their decision to select USASearch is exactly what we hope motivates each agency to use USASearch.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The &#8216;out of the box&#8217; search results are much more relevant than our prior search results because it harnesses the power of a world-class search engine and the program offers us a great amount of control for suggesting the best links for certain search results and ensuring that new content or breaking news is included in the search results.</p>

<p>Thank you, DOL!</p>

      <p>Gartner recently published a very positive case study on USASearch (<a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=1909916"><em>Create Better, Faster Enterprise Search With a Customized Open-Source Option</em></a>, January 2012). In the report, Gartner notes that USASearch addresses the key aspects of designing a search system.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Gartner identifies key stages of action in &#8220;Your Enterprise Search Project: The Outward Spiral.&#8221; USASearch addressed them all:</p>
<ul><li><em>Staffing</em> the project with experts who had domain knowledge.</li>
<li><em>Scoping</em> the project using those personnel to satisfy search requirements for federal websites.</li>
<li><em>Selecting</em> the right technology.</li>
<li><em>Implementing</em> it effectively with workers who have the right skill sets.</li>
<li><em>Measuring</em> results as effectively as possible.</li>

      <p>The USASearch tool is awesome. It makes finding things on our website easier than ever. The results that come back are both quick and relevant. My favorite feature has to be Query Logs. What our users are looking for is now crystal clear, which makes my life way easier. It provides insight into what users want that is sometimes very hard to find. It also allows us to promote the correct content.</p>




<p>For instance, for several months our most search terms were employment and jobs, so we created a Jobs page and put it right on our homepage. After that the search for those terms dropped dramatically, which means users no longer had to poke and search for Jobs/Employment information because it was right where it needed to be.</p>




<p>I almost couldn&#8217;t believe that this amazing service is free. It&#8217;s easy to implement and full of useful features, which would normally cost us quite a lot and in this economy it&#8217;s these types of services that help us save money.</p>

      <p>We encourage the use of shared services across government agencies and we want to make WhiteHouse.gov an example for others to follow. It would not be possible to match the value of GSA’s free search service by procuring or building a custom solution. Previously, we needed to dedicate significant resources to configuring and tuning our internal solution, whereas with USASearch, we can now deploy these resources to enhance the features of and technology supporting the White House website.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://co.des-moines.ia.us">County of Des Moines, Iowa</a>, recently switched to using the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">USASearch Affiliate Program</a>.</p>


<p>About its ease of set up and the advantages of using USASearch over other possibilities as  their search service, Des Moines County IT Department staff shared:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I was able to set-up the search feature in a few minutes and it is working wonderfully for our site.</p>
<p>I used it to replace the search that was originally set-up by the company that designed our site a few years ago, which was no longer working properly for us, and which we did not want to pay them $100/yr to have an ad-free search. I will eventually customize this, but for now the process of creating it and adding the search feature back on our site was super easy.</p>
<p>Thank you and your company for offering this free service to county governments.</p>

      <p>One of the primary goals of <a href="http://search.usa.gov/program">USASearch</a> is to offer government agencies a free search service through its <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">Affiliate Program</a> so that they can reach their own goal of sharing their agency’s resources and information with the public.<br/><br/>In a recent online discussion, USASearch was praised by the <a href="http://www.doi.gov">Dept. of the Interior</a>’s <a href="http://www.bia.gov">Indian Affairs</a> for offering some critically important services. Indian Affairs (IA), established in 1824, is the oldest bureau of the Dept. of the Interior. The agency provides services to 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives.<br/><br/>About the advantages of using USASearch over other possibilities as their search service, Indian Affairs IT specialist Stanley Smith advised an online questioner:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The biggest advantage is the Terms of Service. That, coupled with USASearch’s solid support and neat preview search results ability, are the reasons why we chose to go with USASearch. I would add that USASearch can customize the footer of the search results page as well. Also, they have analytics that are built-in. Analytics have been a really helpful tool that comes with USASearch.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Smith!  We appreciate your allowing us to share your positive opinion that the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">USASearch Affiliate Program</a> is a good choice for government agencies.</p>
