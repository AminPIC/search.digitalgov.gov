      <p>USASearch improved the quality of NC.gov's search results 1000-fold. Results are relevant, helpful, and reliable. Setting up the site search is easy, and the instructions for including the search box on a website are clear and easy—including search that must cross many domains. Customer service is superb. I would recommend USASearch to any government agency.</p>

      <p>After our migration of Commerce.gov to Drupal, we used the native search tool. However, after looking at the internal site search analytics, it was obvious visitors were not finding what they were looking for. USASearch integrated easily into our system and provided several new features. I appreciate the auto-fill and sort by source features and so do our visitors. Our analytics logs report a much higher percentage of searches resulting in what the visitor was looking for.</p>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>Last year the Department of Labor (DOL) participated in the <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/usability/first-fridays">First Fridays</a> Product Testing Program, a “discount” usability testing session designed to find and fix usability problems on <a href="http://www.dol.gov">DOL.gov</a>.</p>


<p>The experience led the DOL web team to <a href="http://social.dol.gov/blog/improving-our-website/">improve DOL.gov</a>, including changing their search engine.</p>


<p>So it was satisfying to learn that they decided to use USASearch to power the search on DOL.gov.  The basis of their decision to select USASearch is exactly what we hope motivates each agency to use USASearch.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The 'out of the box' search results are much more relevant than our prior search results because it harnesses the power of a world-class search engine and the program offers us a great amount of control for suggesting the best links for certain search results and ensuring that new content or breaking news is included in the search results.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Thank you, DOL!</p>

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>Gartner recently published a very positive case study on USASearch (<a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=1909916"><em>Create Better, Faster Enterprise Search With a Customized Open-Source Option</em></a>, January 2012). In the report, Gartner notes that USASearch addresses the key aspects of designing a search system.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Gartner identifies key stages of action in &#8220;Your Enterprise Search Project: The Outward Spiral.&#8221; USASearch addressed them all:</p>
<ul><li><em>Staffing</em> the project with experts who had domain knowledge.</li>
<li><em>Scoping</em> the project using those personnel to satisfy search requirements for federal websites.</li>
<li><em>Selecting</em> the right technology.</li>
<li><em>Implementing</em> it effectively with workers who have the right skill sets.</li>
<li><em>Measuring</em> results as effectively as possible.</li>

      <p>The USASearch tool is awesome. It makes finding things on our website easier than ever. The results that come back are both quick and relevant. My favorite feature has to be Query Logs. What our users are looking for is now crystal clear, which makes my life way easier. It provides insight into what users want that is sometimes very hard to find. It also allows us to promote the correct content.</p>




<p>For instance, for several months our most search terms were employment and jobs, so we created a Jobs page and put it right on our homepage. After that the search for those terms dropped dramatically, which means users no longer had to poke and search for Jobs/Employment information because it was right where it needed to be.</p>




<p>I almost couldn't believe that this amazing service is free. It's easy to implement and full of useful features, which would normally cost us quite a lot and in this economy it's these types of services that help us save money.</p>

      <p>We encourage the use of shared services across government agencies and we want to make WhiteHouse.gov an example for others to follow. It would not be possible to match the value of GSA’s free search service by procuring or building a custom solution. Previously, we needed to dedicate significant resources to configuring and tuning our internal solution, whereas with USASearch, we can now deploy these resources to enhance the features of and technology supporting the White House website.</p>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>The New York State <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/">Department of Environmental Conservation</a> (DEC) was  created on July 1,1970 to combine in a single agency all state programs  designed to protect and enhance the environment. Its mission is to conserve, improve and protect New  York's natural resources and environment and to prevent, abate and  control water, land and air pollution, in order to enhance the health,  safety and welfare of the people of the state and their overall economic  and social well-being.</p>


<p>DEC recently rolled out a new site search functionality using the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">USASearch Affiliate Program</a>. Be sure to visit DEC's <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/">website</a> and take a look for yourself.</p>

<p>Regarding their experience, the DEC web team shares:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>We rolled out the search on our public website last week. So far, all  of the feedback has been extremely positive. Everyone here loves the  new search so thank you for providing this service to us!</p>

<p>We're glad to hear that we were able to help improve their customers' search experience.</p>
