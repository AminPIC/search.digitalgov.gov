    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>Type-ahead search is fast becoming a best practice on websites, and we’ve made this technology available for your site. By default, searchers see type-ahead search suggestions on your search results page.</p>


<p>It is a feature that helps your site's visitors construct a search query and navigate more quickly to a search results page.</p>


<p>Suggestions display as a list in a drop-down box. This list forms as the searcher begins to type in the search box. The searcher can stop typing and scan the list presented and click on any term in the drop-down list, or the searcher can resume typing if the choices in the list are not helpful. The queries are listed in order of most popular (i.e., most searched) and not in alphabetical order.</p>


<p><img alt="Type-ahead suggestions for 'hous' on USA.gov" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lwgn3kYff81qid15q.png"/></p>


<p>To implement the Type-ahead Search feature, log in to the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates">Admin Center</a>. After logging in, you have choices to make.</p>


<h2>Type-ahead on the Search Results Page</h2>


<p>Enable this feature by checking the box labeled Enable Type-ahead search. You can disable it by unchecking the box later if you want.</p>


<p><em><strong>Populate.</strong></em></p>


<p>Terms and phrases are automatically populated on a regular basis from searches done in your site's search box.</p>


<p>On day one of testing USASearch, there will be no terms in Type-ahead Search (unless you add terms to the list, as noted below). The list of terms will build up over time once you implement USASearch on your live website and searchers type their queries in the search box on your site.</p>


<p><em><strong>Add terms to the list.</strong></em></p>


<p>You may choose to add terms to the list that displays in type-ahead search. You may:</p>


<ol><li>Upload an individual term (i.e. click on &#8220;Add a New Entry&#8221;), or</li>
<li>Add a group of terms all at once (i.e., click on &#8220;Bulk Upload&#8221;).<br/><br/>To bulk upload:</li>
</ol>


<ul><li>Create a new text file, one entry per line, for example,<br/><br/>acadia national park<br/>okefenokee<br/>okefenokee swamp<br/>yosemite national park<br/>yosemite valley</li>
</ul>


<ul><li>Save as a text file—{filename}.txt—on your computer. (Do <em>not </em>save as spreadsheet or word processing files, such as .xls or .doc.)</li>
<li>Add, modify, or delete individual entries in the file.</li>
<li>Browse for the text file on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the file to the Affiliate Center.</li>
</ul>


<p><em><strong>Delete terms from the list.</strong></em></p>


<p>You may also delete individual terms that you don't want listed, through &#8220;Current Entries&#8221;. Use &#8220;Filter&#8221; to search for particular terms to edit.</p>


<h2>Type-ahead on Other Web Pages</h2>


<p>You can also add the type-ahead search suggestions to your homepage—or wherever you have a search box on your website—by adding the type-ahead JavaScript code to the head to your HTML web page.</p>


<p>Visit our [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home), select your site, and click on the Get Code option in the left-hand menu. For more details, read our post on <a href="/manual/get-code.html">How to Add Our Code to Your Website</a>.</p>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Some scholars have alleged that possibly Shakespeare, writing the above for his play Romeo and Juliet, was also slyly poking fun at the latrine-challenged rival theatre, The Rose, across the road from The Globe. There can be multiple intentions behind using a particular word, and the word itself may have several meanings, synonyms, and spelling variations.</p>


<p>In our query logs, for example, we have noticed that the term <em>immigration </em>has been misspelled with at least 20 variations, including: imagration, imegration, imergration,  imgration, imigation, imiigration, immagration, and so forth. </p>


<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a> is the federal government portal for the whole country. We are serving people of different ages, different levels of education, different linguistic backgrounds, and people who may type hastily or just badly. We want people to have a good search experience, if we can help them figure out where they want to go with their queries.</p>


<p>Even if their 4th grade soccer coach was more bedazzling than their 4th grade spelling teacher, we don’t want our users bogged down at the beginning of their search with a spelling mistake if we can help them. Our goal is to get you to relevant results with as few detours as possible.  So, we have added several features to help the public navigate smoothly through a misspelled search query and on to a good search results page.</p>


<p>One feature we employ is a spell checker which detects possibly misspelled words by using a background dictionary to compare search words to.</p>


<p><img alt="Spelling override option for a search on imegration" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lpzfhhhH4b1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p>Notice in the above example that users are still allowed to tweak the contents of the search results and insist on just the results for <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=imegration"><em>imegration</em></a> if they want to.</p>


<p>Spell checkers have evolved over the years from concluding that a word that isn’t in the background dictionary must be a misspelling and then arbitrarily adjusting the search results presented, to allowing the possibility that the search query is actually correctly formed. Having a spell checker blunder in and correct something that isn’t incorrect can cause frustration if users find themselves in a fruitless loop of logical idiocy. For instance, <em>solr</em> is a common misspelling of <em>solar</em>, but it is also the name of an open-source search server.  The public can now override unhelpful spell checker guesses.</p>


<p>Another way of helping the public navigate from misspellings to the form of a word that will go to good results is type-ahead search. This feature suggests topics in a drop down box as the public types in the search box. Type-ahead search suggests popular queries for aspects of a topic, but also gently reroutes the public to the correct spelling of a word.</p>


<p><img alt="Type-ahead suggestion correcting the spelling of mortgage" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lpzfe9O7cl1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><em>Morgage</em> is a very common misspelling of <em>mortgage</em>. Once the public types in most of the misspelled word, the editorially managed type-ahead search presents the correct spelling of the word, and then the most popular searches for <em>mortgage</em>.  Users can quickly browse the list and select what looks right. This is designed to present the public with the most likely search term which will then provide quick navigation to good search results. Users can also ignore the type-ahead search list, finish typing their own search query, and then click on Search and go to the results.</p>
