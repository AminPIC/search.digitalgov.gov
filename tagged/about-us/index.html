      <a href="/blog/serp-redesign.html">Our Redesign: Before and After</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/17/bing-reveals-its-redesign-and-latest-improvements/">Bing</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027704/how-googles-redesigned-search-results-augur-a-more-beautiful-web">Google</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, and <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/06/05/yahoo-redesigns-its-search-page/">Yahoo</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> have all rolled out major redesigns to their search results pages in the past year.</p>

<p>The last time we did a major redesign of our results page was in January 2012. It was long overdue for a facelift.</p>

<p>So, we've redesigned our search results page. We've kept an eye on best practices in the search industry and what media websites (like NPR.org and NYTimes.com) are up to, But, we're not simply following the leaders. We've also <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/07/analyzing-search-data-in-real-time-to-drive-decisions/">analyzed our search data</a> to make data-driven decisions that, ultimately, aim to make searchers' experience better on your site.</p>

<p>Below are some of the highlights.</p>

<h2>Basic Search Results</h2>

<p>We started with the basic search result. Here's the before and after for a search on <em>passport</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-search-result.png" title="Search result for passport on USA.gov" alt="Search result for passport on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>We've done away with the underlining on the title. The snippet is wider and has more space. Clicking or touching anywhere on the snippet (not just the title) opens the link.</p>

<h2>Video Results</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>careers</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-video.png" title="Video search result for careers on USA.gov" alt="Video search result for careers on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new video format shows one video plus a clearly labeled "More videos about ..." link. It also shows the video's source (in this case YouTube), the length of the video, and a short snippet. The video is now separated from basic search results by thin grey lines.</p>

<h2>Tweets</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>social security</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-tweet.png" title="Tweet for social security on USA.gov" alt="Tweet for social security on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new tweet format shows one tweet inline with the results. It now shows the agency's Twitter profile image and the tweet is separated from basic search results by thin grey lines and doesn't have a separate heading. The old format had tweets in a right-hand column that was often mistaken for an ad.</p>

<h2>Search Verticals</h2>

<p>Here's the before and after for a search on <em>jobs</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com//redesign-verticals.png" title="Search verticals on USA.gov" alt="Search verticals on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new format clusters all options to narrow, broaden, or change the scope of the results together, and places these options directly above the search box. It also shows up to three options with ability to show More &hellip;. The old format placed verticals in the left-hand column below the box and the option to search on related sites in the right-hand column above the box.</p>

<h2>By Government, for Government</h2>

<p>Our search results page now ensures the public has a common search experience anywhere, anytime, and on any device. This meets a key objective of the federal government's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a>.</p>

<p>It has also been tested to ensure it is <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">accessible to people with disabilities</a>.</p>

<p>This brief posting period is because of our interest in accelerating the hiring process and shouldn't be interpreted as an indication that someone has already been selected.</p>

<p>About Us: We're a commercial-grade service that gives the public a great search experience on government websites. With about 20 million searches each month, we power the search box on some of the most visited government websites, including NASA.gov, SocialSecurity.gov, USA.gov, USCIS.gov, WhiteHouse.gov, and 12 states' websites. It's so easy to take for granted. You go to a website, enter a term in the search box, and find the results you're looking for. But imagine the cost and time involved if every government agency and website had to acquire and run its own search engine. We take that burden off agencies' hands. By using free or low-cost commercial APIs and open source software, we currently provide the service free to any federal, state, or local agency.</p>

    <h1>
      <a href="/blog/open-source.html">Our Open Source Strategy</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>We keep an eye on on our what our government counterparts are up to, both in the U.S. and other countries. We recently came across <a href="https://www.gov.uk">Gov.UK's</a> philosophy on and approach to <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open">coding in the open</a>. It caught our attention and we realized we should also articulate our open source strategy.</p>

<h2>Use and Contribute to Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>Since 2010, we've embraced and leveraged open source software to build our site search service for federal, state, and local government websites. This use of open source has allowed us to experience enormous growth over the past few years. In March 2013 alone, over 24 million searchers received results from our service&mdash;a four-fold increase since March 2010.</p>

<p>Our search service is now a complex system made up of many moving parts, including providing type-ahead search suggestions, serving search results, fetching, indexing, and caching content, and providing analytics.</p>

<p>Each of these parts is compiled into our codebase and, as we use open source components for our system, we contribute back to the projects.</p>

<h2>Code in the Open</h2>

<p>We recently began to unravel our monolithic codebase so that we can share individual pieces of our code. To borrow the phrase from Gov.UK, we're now <strong><em>coding in the open</em></strong>.</p>

<p>We recently released the code for our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">Jobs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls</a> API servers. They're our first foray into coding in the open. The source code for these API servers is in <a href="https://github.com/GSA">our GitHub repo</a> and is available for anyone to see and contribute to.</p>

<p>The data products for this code are also open and available for anyone to consume on our <a href="/developer/index.html">Developer hub</a>.</p>

<p>These two servers and their underlying data now operate outside of our core search codebase.</p>

<p>Following this same model, moving forward, we plan to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Share first&mdash;For every new feature, we'll write the code so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the code, not just us. If the public community contributes to the codebase, we'll be able to improve this feature without taxing our developers.</p></li>
<li><p>Expose APIs&mdash;We'll expose our data products as APIs so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the data, not just searchers on a government websites.</p></li>
<li><p>Be our own customer&mdash;We'll use our own public code and data just like everyone else. We'll call our own API servers to integrate the data within our search results pages.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Make Things Open to Make Things Better</h2>

<p>We agree with Gov.UK that "to make things open makes things better."</p>

<p>We have finite resources and we don't want to lose our focus on serving our agency customers and improving visitors' search experience on government websites. So, we won't be spending a lot of time to build or support a vibrant community around our code.</p>

<p>That said, we hope that exposing the pieces of our system will be useful to someone somewhere. We'll continue to provide the "ingredients" of our search service so that others will be able to make use of the code and data in ways that we could never imagine.</p>

<h2>And, We're Not Alone</h2>

<p>We're not alone. Other federal agencies have embraced the approach of coding in the open and have <a href="http://gsa.github.io/federal-open-source-repos">GitHub repos</a>. Below are a just a few of our many favorites.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="http://www.cfpb.gov">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> has embraced open source, including serving their public data sets through <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/qu">qu</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> recently released the code for their <a href="https://github.com/usagov/usagov-ios-app">iPhone app</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> was in the forefront of using open source software in the federal government with their use of Drupal. They're continuing to lead by example by opening up the code for their <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions">We the People petitions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-ios">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-android">Android</a> mobile apps.</p></li>
</ul>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>The following terms of service ("Terms") govern the General Services Administration's (GSA) DigitalGov Search website and services, including the content, documentation, code and related materials, are offered subject to your acceptance of the Terms as well as any relevant sections of the DigitalGov <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/about/policies/">Site Policies</a> (collectively, the "Agreement"). Access to or use of DigitalGov Search services or its content constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>

<ul>
<li>We don't collect any personally-identifiable information nor use persistent cookies.</li>
<li>When you use DigitalGov Search, we store information about searches on your site, including: the web page from which searchers accessed your search results, the date and time, the words searched for, items clicked on a page, and the browser and operating system used. We periodically delete our search logs.</li>
<li>We use this information to measure the usage of our website and services and to identify system performance or problem areas. We also use this information to help us develop the service, analyze patterns of usage, and to make the service more useful. This information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. We may anonymize and provide this information to third-party entities for the purposes of analyzing search traffic.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Secondary Use</h3>

<ul>
<li>Customers using our Search Data API cannot cache results.</li>
<li>Data accessed through our website and services does not, and should not, include controls over its end use.</li>
<li>Once the data has been downloaded from DigitalGov Search, we can't vouch for the quality or timeliness of any analyses conducted with data retrieved.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Citing Data</h2>

<p>Customers using the Search Data API must display the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/4/E/04E076D4-60B2-4D31-BCC7-C4805B558DBB/Bing%20product%20guidelines.pdf">Powered by Bing</a> [PDF] logo on 'web' and 'image' search results pages for attribution of these results. Customers using any of the other three indexes ('docs', 'news', and 'videonews') must display "Powered by DigitalGov Search" (using plain text or <a href="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/digitalgov_search_logo.png">our logo</a> for DigitalGov Search) for attribution instead of the Bing logo.</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<h3>Use of Open Source Software</h3>

<p>DigitalGov Search uses open-source software and free or low cost, commercial application programming interfaces when it best meets the needs and mission of GSA.</p>

<h3>Redistribution of Code</h3>

<ol>
<li>Software source code written entirely by GSA staff, and by contractors who are developing software on behalf of GSA, is by default a public domain work.</li>
<li>Software source code previously released under an open source license and then modified by GSA staff is considered a "joint work." It is partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to the terms of the original open-source license.</li>
<li><p>All source code as defined above may be shared with the general public via a highly visible, easily accessible online source code community (such as Github) that facilitates the code's reuse. Source code won't be released if any of the following conditions are met:</p></li>
<li><p>The author of the code determines that the code is too crude to merit distribution or provide value to the broader community.</p></li>
<li>The Government doesn't have the rights to reproduce and release the item. The Government has public release rights when the software is developed by Government personnel, when the Government receives "unlimited rights" in software developed by a contractor at Government expense, or when pre-existing OSS is modified by or for the Government.</li>
<li>The public release of the item is restricted by other law or regulation, such as the Export Administration Regulations or the International Traffic in Arms Regulation.</li>
<li>GSA cybersecurity staff determine that the public release of such code would pose an unacceptable risk to GSA's operational security.</li>
</ol>

      <a href="/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html">I Didn't Try to Grow a Bigger Ox:  How I Found Hadoop</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>A year ago I rolled my first Hadoop system into production. Since then, I've spoken to quite a few people who are eager to try Hadoop themselves in order to solve their own big data problems. Despite having similar backgrounds and data problems, few of these people have sunk their teeth into Hadoop. When I go to Hadoop Meetups in San Francisco, I often meet new people who are evaluating Hadoop and have yet to launch a cluster. Based on my own background and experience, I have some ideas on why this is the case.</p>

<p>I studied computer science in school and have worked on a wide variety of computer systems in my career, with a lot of focus on server-side Java. I learned a bit about building distributed systems and working with large amounts of data when I built a pay-per-click (PPC) ad network in 2004. The system is still in operation and at one point was handling several thousand searches per second. As the sole technical resource on the system, I had to educate myself very quickly about how to scale up.</p>

<p>As I contemplated how doomed I would be should traffic levels increase much more, I remember wondering to myself, "How does Google deal with all that data?" The answer came to me in the form of the Google File System (GFS) paper and later the MapReduce paper, both from Google. It dawned on me that because Google was forced to solve a much larger problem, they had come up with an elegant solution for a whole range of more modest data problems running on commodity hardware. But it wouldn't be until 2010 that I would get to work with this technology firsthand.</p>

<p>As I wrote in an <a href="/blog/adopting-hadoop.html">earlier article</a>, I started re-architecting DigitalGov Search, the U.S. government's search system, in 2009 based on a solution stack of free, open source software including Ruby on Rails, Solr, and MySQL. A wave of déja vu hit me as I started worrying about what to do with the growing mountain of data piling up in MySQL and our increasing need to analyze it in different ways. I had heard that a new company called Cloudera, founded by some big data people from Yahoo!, Google, and Facebook, was making Hadoop available for the masses in a reliable distribution, much in the same way that RedHat did for Linux. Curiosity got the best of me and I bought the newly minted <em>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</em> from O'Reilly. The most insightful part of the book to me was the very first sentence. It's a quote from Grace Hopper: "In pioneer days, they used oxen for heavy pulling, and when one ox couldn't budge a log, they didn't try to grow a bigger ox." I didn't want to grow a bigger server; I wanted to harness a bunch of small servers together to work in unison. The more I learned the more curious I got, so I started reading more. And that's when I hit my first roadblock.</p>

<p>I think people who have been working with Hadoop technologies for years and years sometimes forget just how rich and diverse the big data software ecosystem has become, and how daunting it can be to folks approaching it for the first time. When people at the Meetups say they are evaluating solutions to their data scaling problem, the answers they hear sound something like this: "Just use Hadoop Hive Pig Mahout Avro HBase Cassandra Oozie Sqoop Flume ZooKeeper Cascading NoSQL RCFile. Oh, almost forgot…cloud."</p>

<p>The thought of wading through all of that just to learn about what I needed to learn about was a bit too overwhelming for me, so I put the whole matter aside for a few months. Over time, I started to dive into each of these projects to understand the primary use case, how active the developer community was and which organizations were using it in production. I converged on the idea of using Hive as a warehouse for our data. I opted for Cloudera's distribution since I wanted to reduce the risk of running into compatibility issues between all the various subsystems. Having tracked down anomalies in a highly multi-threaded and contentious distributed Java system before, I liked the idea of someone else taking on that problem for me.</p>

<p>At some point, I had read everything I could read and grew impatient to get my hands dirty, so I decided to just download CDH3 on my laptop and give it a try. The tutorial instructions for the standalone version worked, and I successfully computed more digits of pi than I ever thought I'd need. After creating some sample data in Hive and running a few queries, I felt pretty confident that Hive would be the right tool for the job. I just needed to find somewhere to install and run HDFS (namenode, secondary namenode, and data nodes), Hadoop (jobtracker and tasktracker nodes), Hive, and Hue for a nice front end to it all.</p>

<p>I knew from my past experience how to stretch the limits of CPU, disk, IO, and memory on commodity servers, and I identified a few potential servers at our primary datacenter with resources I figured I could leverage. Once again I followed the tutorial instructions, this time for the fully distributed version of CDH3, and once again I started to compute pi. And that's when I hit my second roadblock. It took me a few days to figure out that I had a problem with DNS. Each machine needs to be able to resolve every other machine's name and IP in the cluster. Whether you do that via /etc/hosts or a local DNS server is up to you, but it needs to happen or the whole thing gets wedged. Once I got that sorted out, everything just started falling into place and I had Hive working in production within a few days. A week later, I started pulling out the MySQL jobs and deleting big tables, and that's been the trend ever since.</p>

<p>Over time, I've gone on to learn about using custom Ruby mappers in Hive, moving data back and forth between MySQL and Hive with Sqoop, and getting the data into HDFS in real-time with Flume. All of these components from the Cloudera distribution are working nicely in our production environment now, and I sleep well at night knowing I have such a solid, deliberate plan for growth. My initial investment in learning about the Hadoop ecosystem is really paying dividends, but when I think about all those people at the Meetups stuck in evaluation mode, I feel their pain. Does it have to be such a struggle?</p>

<p>The big challenge in my opinion is not that any one piece of the puzzle is too difficult. Any reasonably smart (or in my case stubborn) engineer can set themselves on the task of learning about a new technology once they know that it needs to be learned. The challenge with the Hadoop ecosystem is that it presents the newbie with the meta-problem of figuring out which of these tools are appropriate for their use case at all, and whether or not to even consider the problem today versus deferring it until later. In a way Facebook has it easy, because when you are adding 15TB of data per day, that decision is pretty much made for you.</p>

<p>For all the companies sitting in the twilight between the gigabyte and the petabyte who don't have Hadoop expertise in-house, there is a collection of free information to help guide people to the right solution space (Hadoop Tutorial, White Papers). These days, when I talk to people who are evaluating solutions to their big data problems, my advice to them is to break down their problems into a few discrete use cases and then work on ferreting out the technologies that are designed for that use case. Get a proof of concept to demonstrate that the technology can address your use case and convince yourself and others that you're on the right track. Work toward putting something simple into production. Lather, rinse, and repeat. I am still in that cycle myself, as these days I'm exploring HBase and OpenTSDB to give me low-latency access to time series data and Mahout to do frequent item set mining, but that's another article for another day.</p>

      <h2>Slowness Hurts Web Pages</h2>

<p>Have you ever been frustrated when visiting a web page that doesn't load quickly? Have you ever left a slow web page before it finished loading? You're not alone.</p>

<p>Several recent studies have quantified customers' frustration with slow web pages. Customers now  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html">expect results in the blink of an eye</a>.&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> This expection means that your <a href="http://www.aberdeen.com/Aberdeen-Library/5136/RA-performance-web-application.aspx">customers are won or lost in one second</a>.&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> A one second delay in loading a web page equals 11% fewer page views, 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, and 7% loss in conversions.</p>

<h2>Slowness <em>Kills</em> Search Results Pages</h2>

<p>As little time as web sites have to keep users on their pages, search engines have even less time to keep searchers on their results pages. Speed is the primary factor in determining customers' satisfaction with search results.</p>

<p>Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo garner <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/11/comScore_Releases_October_2013_US_Search_Engine_Rankings">95% of the search market</a>.&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> Google garners two-thirds of the search market. The company's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Google+Gospel+of+Speed">Gospel of Speed</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> motto is one reason why Google garners the majority of the market.</p>

<p>This gospel has also set a high bar for all search engines. Searchers expect results pages to load very, very quickly.</p>

<h2>How We've Made Our Result Pages Load Faster</h2>

<p>So, when we established the service's open source architecture in 2010, the first thing we tackled was how to deliver our search results in under one second.</p>

<p>At around the same time, <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> was experiencing exponential growth and the company's engineers were blogging about what they did to make Github fast. To get up to speed quickly (yes, bad pun intended), we read their posts.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blog/530-how-we-made-github-fast">How We Made GitHub Fast</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, October 20, 2009</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blog/1252-how-we-keep-github-fast">How We Keep GitHub Fast</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, September 5, 2012</li>
</ul>


<p>Leveraging some of Github's best practices, we succeeded in delivering our results in under 700 milliseconds, on average. This was a significant accomplishment and improvement from the previous vendor-owned and -operated iterations of our service.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, we've dug in and improved our response time even more. We now deliver our results in under 380 milliseconds, on average.</p>

<p><img src="https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/serp_reponse_times.png" title="App server response times" alt="App server response times" /></p>

<p>We already had an architecture optimized for speed. So, how have we sped it up by 320 milliseconds?</p>

<h3>We Cache When We Can</h3>

<p>When a searcher enters a query, we go out to our various indexes, pull the information relevant to the searcher's request, and put that information together on the results page.</p>

<p>Most queries (such as jobs, obama, unclaimed money, forms) aren't unique and are asked by thousands of searchers each day.</p>

<p>We cache these so-called short head queries and store them on our servers. Caching helps us speed up the above process because searchers don't have to wait for us to pull the information from its original source.</p>

<h3>We Use an Asset Pipeline</h3>

<p>We have many JavaScript and CSS files on our results pages. These "assets" can be large and slow down the loading of our page. So, we use an <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">asset pipeline</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to concatenate and compress our JavaScript and CSS assets thereby reducing the number of requests that a browser has to make to render our results page.</p>

<p>We also use fingerprinting&mdash;a technique that makes a file's name dependent on its content&mdash;within our asset pipeline. When the content changes, the name changes. For content that is static or that changes infrequently, this naming helps us tell whether two versions of a file are identical. When a filename is unique, browsers keep their own copy of the content. When the content is updated, the fingerprint changes so browsers request a new copy of the content. This approach allows us to maximize our content delivery network.</p>

<h3>We Use a Content Delivery Network</h3>

<p>Our static content (such as scripts and stylesheets) gets served through our <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">content delivery network</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> provider, currently Akamai. Akamai serves our static content from its server that is geographically closest to the searcher. The closer, the faster.</p>

<p>Using a content delivery network also allow us to optimize our service's speed by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Directing non-cached traffic between our two datacenters to create a <a href="/releases/2012-10-19.html">multihomed environment</a>. Multihoming allows us to make full use of all of our servers. By contrast, in 2010, our disaster recovery datacenter often sat idle.</li>
<li>Reducing our need to add bandwidth or servers to handle short-term traffic spurts, such as spurts related to natural disasters.</li>
<li>Protecting against denial of service attacks by spotting them before they reach our servers.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>We've worked hard over the past three years to speed up the delivery of our results by optimizing each link in the chain.</p>

<p>We use several monitoring tools to measure our system's performance. The quality of these tools is improving at a rapid pace, which in turn, shows us where and how we can improve our service.</p>

<p>We regularly ask ourselves, "Will <em>this</em> shave some time off and help us deliver our results in <em>under</em> 380 milliseconds?"</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>

<p>DigitalGov Search (formerly USASearch) got its start when Internet entrepreneur Eric Brewer, whose early research was funded by the Department of Defense, offered to donate a powerful search engine to government. That gift helped accelerate the government's earlier work to create a government-wide portal.</p>

<p>In June 2000, President Clinton announced the gift from the Federal Search Foundation, a nonprofit organization established by Brewer, and instructed that an official U.S. web portal be launched within 90 days. USA.gov went online on September 22, 2000 under the name FirstGov.gov with a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001109105200/http://www.firstgov.gov">prominent search box</a> to allow the public to search across government websites.</p>

      <a href="/blog/legacy-domains.html">Six legacy domains are expiring</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>As part of the federal <a href="http://www.usa.gov/WebReform.shtml">.gov web reform</a> project, we're eliminating six of our legacy domains. Going forward, our only supported domain is search.usa.gov (or search.yoursite.gov, if you've requested <a href="/manual/cname.html">DNS masking</a>).</p>

<p>What do you need to do? If your URL starts with any of the following six legacy domains, you must update your HTML form code.</p>

<ol>
<li>firstgovsearch.gov</li>
<li>searchusa.gov</li>
<li>usasearch.gov</li>
<li>(Spanish) buscador.gov</li>
<li>(Spanish) buscadorusa.gov</li>
<li>(Spanish) usabuscador.gov</li>
</ol>


<p>Specifically, you have to update the action of your <a href="/manual/code.html">form code</a> to call search.usa.gov (or search.yoursite.gov).</p>

<p><code>&lt;form method="get" action="http://search.usa.gov/search"&gt;</code></p>

<p>Note that, if you don't update your form code, your search results page will no longer work.</p>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>DigitalGov Search (formerly USASearch) is the <a href="http://ctolabs.com/gsa-usasearch-wins-2011-government-big-data-solutions-award">winner of the 2011 Government Big Data Solutions Award</a>, announced at <a href="http://www.hadoopworld.com">Hadoop World</a> in New York City on November 8, 2011.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ctolabs.com/big-data-award">Big Data Award</a> was established to highlight innovative solutions and to facilitate the exchange of best practices, lessons learned, and creative ideas for addressing Big Data challenges. The Award judges saw DigitalGov Search as a great example of solving Big Data problems to improve government agility and to provide better service for less.</p>

<p>In line with the GSA's cost-saving "build once, use many times" paradigm, DigitalGov Search provides hosted search services for <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and hundreds of other government websites. This is done in a cost-effective way, especially for the agencies involved, which receive these services at no cost.</p>

<p>From the Award presentation:</p>

<blockquote><p>The GSA is to be congratulated for their mission-focused, citizen-centered, open approach to a big data challenge and a resulting solution that improves the experience of a broad swath of users of federal services. On behalf of our judges and the many citizens who use this capability on a daily basis we say thank you, and congratulations on this well deserved recognition.</p></blockquote>
