    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > i14y Drawers</p>

<p>An <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y</a> Drawer is an index receiving content via the i14y API. We've called them <strong>Drawers</strong> because, like drawers in a filing cabinet, multiple indexes can be included in a single configuration to scope the entirety of a site’s search.</p>

<p>Information on working with our Drupal module is <a href="/manual/drupal.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Make sure your site is connected to i14y</h2>

<p>If your site Admin Center has the following page: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > i14y Drawers, your site is connected to i14y. If you don't see this page in the Admin Center, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>. You can also read about <a href="/developer/i14y.html">Getting Started with i14y</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 2. Add one or more Drawers</h2>

<p>On <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > i14y Drawers, Click <code>Add i14y Drawer</code> in the upper right corner. If you have more than one website that will be sending content, add a separate Drawer for each of these sites.</p>

<h3>Handle</h3>

<p>Let us know what the handle for your drawer should be - the handle must be all lowercase alphanumeric, all one word, and can include underscores but no other special characters (e.g., agency_drawer_handle2).</p>

<p>The Drawer <em>Description</em> is optional</p>

<h2>Step 3. Send Content to Fill your Drawer</h2>

<p>After you have created your Drawer(s), click <code>Show</code> from the i14y Drawers list to find that Drawer’s secret API key. Use this secret key with your drawer handle in your API call or your CMS module to <a href="http://gsa.github.io/slate/#authentication">send your content to the right place</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<h2>Step 4. Review your Index</h2>

<p>You can view the number of documents indexed for each drawer on the main i14y Drawers list, and when the most recent document was received. Click <code>Show</code> to view documents within a particular drawer. We display the most recent 1,000 items that were sent to the drawer. You can also search for keywords in the documents' text, titles, and descriptions (Note: you cannot currently search for URLs).</p>

<p>We send success and / or failure codes in response to your API call, so if the number of documents in our index doesn’t match what you sent, check those response codes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If you experience difficulty sending documents to i14y, it is possible your firewall is not letting you communicate with the i14y server. Check out our <a href="/developer/i14y-testing.html">cURL test commands</a> or view the full <a href="http://gsa.github.io/slate/">i14y documentation on Github</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Caution:</em></strong> A pop-up message will appear when you hit <code>Remove</code> on a drawer: please review this pop-up message carefully. If you remove a drawer that is only associated with one search configuration, the drawer and its contents will be deleted from our system. If the drawer is attached to multiple search configurations, it will only be removed from the search configuration you are currently on. The pop-up message will indicate what type of drawer you have.</p>

<p>If you accidentally delete a drawer, you will need to set-up a new drawer and resend the content - we are unable to retrieve deleted drawers. If you accidentally remove a shared drawer but it is still associated with other search configurations, we can re-attach it to your site. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Contact us</a> for assistance.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> We can attach each i14y drawer to multiple search configurations: if you have a drawer that you’d like to use for multiple search sites, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>.</p>

<h2>What is i14y?</h2>

<p>i14y is a content indexing API that allows you to send your content directly to our indexes. When your site is enabled for i14y, it gives you complete control over what searchers see. No commercial web results will be served: instead, searchers will see content exactly as you've sent it to us.</p>

<h2>How Do I Use i14y?</h2>

<p>We currently have a <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> that will hook your CMS into i14y. You can also check out our <a href="/manual/drupal.html">help docs for working with the Drupal module</a>.</p>

<p>If you use a different CMS, or don't have one at all, you still can develop an API of your content that meets the i14y specs. Read our <a href="http://gsa.github.io/slate/">technical documentation</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to learn more.</p>

<p>We would love to see more CMS hooks in the future. The i14y code is open source, and we welcome your partnership if there's a particular hook you need. There is starter code for a <a href="https://github.com/GSA/wp-digitalgov-i14y-indexer">WordPress plugin</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> that is ready for partner contributions.</p>

<h2>Checklist to Go Live with i14y</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Connect one of your sites to i14y</h3>

<p>i14y needs to be enabled in the back end for a site to be able to receive content through it. You can</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/manual/add-site.html">Add a brand new search site</a>,</li>
<li>Use the Clone Site tool to copy one of your existing site’s settings to a new site (<code>YourSite &gt; Dashboard &gt; Clone Site</code>), or</li>
<li>use an existing site.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Email us</a> and let us know which site you want enabled for i14y. Please note: once we turn on i14y for a site, we no longer serve search results from a commercial web index. Therefore, we recommend that you set up a test site for i14y, so that your customers will continue to get results until you are fully set up and ready to move your i14y index to your production search site.</p>

<h3>Step 2. Add a Drawer</h3>

<p>An i14y Drawer is an index receiving content via the i14y API. We've called them <strong>Drawers</strong> because, like drawers in a filing cabinet, multiple indexes can be included in a single configuration to scope the entirety of a site’s search.</p>

<p>After we have enabled i14y for your search site, a new page will appear: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > i14y Drawers.</p>

<p>Click <code>Add i14y Drawer</code> in the upper right corner. Create a handle for your drawer - the handle must be all lowercase alphanumeric, all one word, and can include underscores but no other special characters (e.g., agency_drawer_handle2).</p>

<p>The Drawer <em>Description</em> is optional.</p>

<p>If you have more than one website or domain that will be sending content, add a separate Drawer for each of these sites. We also recommend setting up separate drawers for staging or test content, so you can easily remove that content from your search site when you are ready to go live.</p>

<h3>Step 3. Fill your Drawer</h3>

<p>After you have created your Drawer(s), click <code>Show</code> from the i14y Drawers list to find that Drawer’s secret API key. Use this secret key with your drawer handle in your API call or your CMS module to send your content to the right place.</p>

<p>You are now ready to add content to your drawer. You can do this in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use i14y directly. <a href="https://github.com/GSA/i14y">Github repo</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> | <a href="http://gsa.github.io/slate/">Technical Documentation</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i></li>
<li>Use a module plugged into your CMS. At this time there is a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> available. Help docs for the module are <a href="/manual/drupal.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 4. Review your index</h3>

<p>You can view the number of documents indexed for each drawer on the main i14y Drawers list, and when the most recent document was received. Click <code>Show</code> to view documents within a particular drawer. We display the most recent 1,000 items that were sent to the drawer. You can also search for keywords in the documents' text, titles, and descriptions (Note: you cannot currently search for URLs).</p>

<p>We send success and / or failure codes in response to your API call, so if the number of documents in our index doesn’t match what you sent, check those response codes.</p>

<p>If you experience difficulty sending documents to i14y, it is possible your firewall is not letting you communicate with the i14y server. Check out our <a href="/developer/i14y-testing.html">cURL test commands</a> or view the full <a href="http://gsa.github.io/slate/">i14y documentation on Github</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>We can attach each i14y drawer to multiple search configurations: if you have a drawer that you’d like to use for multiple search sites, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Caution:</em></strong> A pop-up message will appear when you hit <code>Remove</code> on a drawer: please review this pop-up message carefully. If you remove a drawer that is only associated with one search configuration, the drawer and its contents will be deleted from our system. If the drawer is attached to multiple search configurations, it will only be removed from the search configuration you are currently on. The pop-up message will indicate what type of drawer you have.</p>

<p>If you accidentally delete a drawer, you will need to set-up a new drawer and resend the content - we are unable to retrieve deleted drawers. If you accidentally remove a shared drawer but it is still associated with other search configurations, we can re-attach it to your site. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Contact us</a> for assistance.</p>

<h3>Step 5. Configure your search</h3>

<p>Once you have your index populated, you will <a href="/manual/content-overview.html">set up the rest of your search</a> as you would for a traditional DigitalGov Search site. Set your default search scope on your <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> page, add Social Media accounts (<a href="/manual/flickr.html">Flickr</a>, <a href="/manual/instagram.html">Instagram</a>, <a href="/manual/twitter.html">Twitter</a>, and <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube</a>, create <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collections</a>, and set your results page Display (both <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">search features</a> and <a href="/manual/brand.html">branding</a>).</p>

<p>If you have any <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS content</a> that will not be sent to your i14y drawer, you can add those feeds as well.</p>

<h3>Step 6. Update your search box</h3>

<p>Update your website’s search box <a href="/manual/code.html">form code</a> to point to <code>affiliate=youri14yenabledsitehandle</code>.</p>

<h3>Terms of Use</h3>

<p>By accessing the i14y API, you agree to <a href="https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/terms-of-service.shtml">USA.gov's Terms of Service for Developer Resources</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> i14y is hacker shorthand for "interoperability", because there are 14 characters between the first and last letters. i14y can also be shorthand for Independence Day.</p>

      <p>If you have installed the <code>usasearch</code> <a href="https://drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to integrate your Drupal CMS with the DigitalGov Search service but are having trouble, the following suggestions should help you identify where the problem is. If after working through these items you still have questions, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">reach out to our team</a> and, though we're not Drupal experts, we can try to help.</p>

<p><a href="#search-errors">Skip to Search error troubleshooting tips</a></p>

<h2>Indexing errors</h2>

<h3>Do you have the right module for your Drupal version?</h3>

<p>We have modules for both Drupal 7 and Drupal 8. If your site is in Drupal 7, use <code>usasearch-7.x-5.7</code>. If your site is in Drupal 8, click <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch/releases">View all Releases</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and select API version <code>8.x</code>.</p>

<h3>Have you set up an i14y drawer?</h3>

<p>In order to send content from Drupal to our system, you'll need an index to send the content into. We call these indexes "Drawers", because like drawers in a filing cabinet, all the items put into them will be the content you can search against. <a href="/manual/i14y-drawers.html">Read more about Drawers here</a>. In order to set up a drawer, your search site will need to be enabled for i14y, so <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">contact us</a> to request that.</p>

<h3>Has any content actually been sent to us?</h3>

<p>The module sends content when someone hits <code>save</code> on a node, or when you run <code>re-index site</code>. In Drupal 7, <code>re-index site</code> is found on the main Drupal search settings page (<code>YOUR-DRUPAL-SITE.gov/admin/config/search/settings</code>); in Drupal 8, you can re-index the site from the bottom of the module settings page.</p>

<ul>
<li>If these actions have indeed happened, check the Drupal recent log messages (<code>YOUR-DRUPAL-SITE.gov/admin/reports/dblog</code>) to see if there's anything related to <code>usasearch</code>, and please <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">send us screenshots of the errors</a>.</li>
<li>If these actions haven't yet happened, please hit <code>save</code> on a node, and see if that item appears in your Drawer. You can view the contents of your Drawer by selecting <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> > Your site > Content > i14y Drawers > Show. If the item isn't there, then check the Drupal log for an error.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Is your firewall letting you communicate with us?</h3>

<p>If content isn’t reaching us, it could be that your firewall is not allowing you to reach i14y. Please run the following from the command line, from inside the same firewall as your web server, if possible. Note: you’ll need to customize the string below with your i14y drawer’s handle and secret token (where it says <code>YOURDRAWERHANDLE:YOURDRAWERSECRETTOKEN</code>):</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents" -XPOST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -u YOURDRAWERHANDLE:YOURDRAWERSECRETTOKEN -d '{"document_id":"1", "title":"test item", "created":"2017-02-16T10:19:02", "path":"https://www.usa.gov", "description":"This is a test", "content":"This is a test to see if the agency web server is able to communicate with the i14y API. If this document doesn't show up in the drawer in the admin center, then the i14y location may need to be whitelisted in order to facilitate indexing."}'
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>If you get a <code>403 Forbidden</code> response</p>

<p>Please contact your security team to request the i14y hostname be whitelisted: <code>https://i14y.usa.gov/</code></p>

<p>We can’t give you an IP to whitelist, as our system is hosted in AWS, and so i14y’s IP address changes regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>If you get a <code>200 OK</code> response</p>

<p>Your system is able to communicate with our system, so the issue must lie in how the module is working with your Drupal instance. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Send us</a> all the information and screenshots of errors that you can, and we’ll help you troubleshoot.</p>

<p>Be sure you delete the test document or it will be included in your search results. You can delete it from the command line. Run this command:</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents/1" -XDELETE -u YOURDRAWERHANDLE:YOURDRAWERSECRETTOKEN
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you get any other error response</p>

<p>Please take a screenshot and <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">send it to us</a> to report the issue so we can investigate the error.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Do you have another question?</h3>

<p>If you have another question about indexing with our service through the <code>usasearch</code> Drupal module, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">don't hesitate to ask</a>!</p>

<p><a name="search-errors"></a></p>

<h2>Search errors</h2>

<h3>Is your Drupal site search box showing Drupal search results?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>If you have a <strong>Drupal 7</strong> site</p>

<p>Our Drupal 7 module is designed to take over the native Drupal search box on your site, and direct queries to the site you specify in the <code>affiliate site handle</code> field. If you're seeing other results - either the Drupal search results or a different search site in our system, find out if the search box form code had been manually modified to point to this other location. Our module will only work with out-of-the-box Drupal search boxes. If the search box form code was modified, you'll need to manually point it to our service using the required parameters - you can see <a href="/manual/code.html">general information on form code here</a>, or you can view examples customized to your particular site within the Admin Center, under <code>Activate</code>. You may also be able to restore the form code to the Drupal default, to take advantage of the module's site handle field and be able to modify the site handle without a dev.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a <strong>Drupal 8</strong> site</p>

<p>In Drupal 8, we don't override the native Drupal search box. Instead, you need to place a <code>USA Search Form</code> block, and disable the default Drupal search. To do this, go to <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-SITE.gov/admin/structure/block</code> in your Drupal site, and do <code>ctrl-F</code> to locate the word <code>Search</code> in the list. Disable the block that says just <code>Search</code>. Use <code>Place block</code> to insert a <code>USA Search Form</code> block in the block region of your choice. The search box in this block will point at the search site you entered in the module settings.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Is the Drupal site search box directing to the wrong DigitalGov Search site?</h3>

<p>Your search box should use the site handle you entered on the module settings page. If you run a search and are brought to our search results page, but see the wrong search site, check to see if the Drupal search box form code was manually modified to point to another search site handle (the <code>affiliate</code> parameter in the form code). If it was modified, you'll need to change the site handle directly in that modified code. You may also be able to restore the form code to the Drupal default, to take advantage of the module's site handle field and be able to modify the site handle without a developer.</p>

      <p>To use the DigitalGov Search service on a Drupal-based website, you should install the <code>usasearch</code> <a href="https://drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. It is possible to manually modify Drupal to connect to our service, but the module allows you to minimize the development work required for ongoing use and maintenance.</p>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>This documentation will walk you through setting up the <code>usasearch</code> <a href="https://drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal 7 module</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> field by field, to integrate your Drupal CMS with the DigitalGov Search service. If you have trouble, take a look at our <a href="/manual/drupal-module-troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting tips</a>.</p>

<p>These instructions follow the order of settings listed in our Drupal module at <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-7-SITE.gov/admin/config/search/usasearch</code>.</p>

<p>Instructions for setting up the <strong>Drupal 8</strong> module are <a href="/manual/drupal-8-module-instructions.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Affiliate site handle</h2>

<p>Required. Enter the site handle you gave your search site. This is found in our <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> > Your site > Dashboard > Settings.</p>

<h2>Drawer Handle</h2>

<p>Required. Enter your i14y  "drawer handle”. This is the name you gave your drawer and is found in: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> > Your site > Manage Content > i14y Drawers.</p>

<h2>i14y API Secret Token</h2>

<p>Required. Enter your i14y drawer’s “secret token”. This can be found in our system in: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> > Your site > Manage Content > i14y Drawers, select the option, <code>Show</code>.</p>

<h2>Enable autocomplete</h2>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Checked.</p>

<p>Check this box if you want to enable the Javascript for our <a href="/developer/">Type-ahead API</a>. Suggestions for popular queries will appear below your search box as searchers begin typing. A query must have been run more than 10 times in a day for it to become a search suggestion.</p>

<h2>Search domain</h2>

<p>We offer <a href="/manual/cname.html">domain masking</a>, which allows you to display <code>search.YOURAGENCY.gov</code> in the URL of your search results page, instead of the default <code>search.usa.gov</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Only change this setting if you have domain masking configured for your search site! If you haven’t set it up, leave the default <code>https://search.usa.gov</code> until you’ve completed the masking steps.</p>

<h2>Alternate indexing domain</h2>

<p>Do you edit your site on one domain or subdomain, but publish on another? If so, use this field to set the domain you want us to present for your content on the search results page. For instance, if you enter <code>www.YOURAGENCY.gov</code> here, nodes that are stored in Drupal under <code>edit.YOURAGENCY.gov</code> would be indexed with us as <code>www.YOURAGENCY.gov</code>.</p>

<h2>Use rules to index content</h2>

<p>Check this box to index content manually with rules. IMPORTANT: If checked, the DigitalGov Search index will not be updated unless specified in a rule action.</p>

<p>Be sure to write rules for your content types in sets of three:
* adding to the index
* updating the index
* deleting from the index</p>

<h2>Results Description View Mode</h2>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Teaser.</p>

<p>Select the search result description text that works best for your site. Choose among the text you’ve set as your teaser, RSS item content, Drupal search index snippet, or full text. The view mode will need to be enabled and configured for each content type. If the view mode is not available for a content type, "Teaser" will be used. We will still index and search the full text of your content if <code>Indexed content view mode</code> is <code>Full content</code>.</p>

<p>Note: If you don't like the content that's being sent to us as the Teaser, you can make changes for that content type's at <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-7-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/[CONTENT TYPE] &gt; Display settings</code> or at <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-7-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/[CONTENT TYPE]/display/teaser</code>.</p>

<h2>Indexed content view mode</h2>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Full content.</p>

<p>If you don't want the full text of your nodes to be searchable, select a preferred view mode to define the content that gets indexed. If the view mode is not available for a content type <code>Full content</code> will be used.</p>

<h2>Include by content type unless explicitly excluded</h2>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Checked.</p>

<p>Check this box to include entire content types in the search index. Include or exclude particular content types in their entirety in the DigitalGov Search settings for the content type's structure page, e.g. <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-7-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/article</code>. You can exclude individual nodes using the DigitalGov Search Settings within the node edit view.</p>

<p>If this box is unchecked, node indexing will need to be managed individually. We recommend you leave the box checked on the module settings.</p>

<p>If you exclude a content type from indexing, and later decide to <em>include</em> it, nodes of this type will be indexed on the next cron run. You may also want to review any nodes that were created in the interim, to ensure in their individual DigitalGov Search settings that they are enabled for indexing.</p>

<h2>Save configuration</h2>

<p>After you save these settings, the module will send a command to us when you hit <code>Save</code> on a node in Drupal, either to add a node to the index, update it, or delete from the index.</p>

<p>If you select <code>re-index site</code> on the main Drupal search settings page (see below), we will begin a full-site reindexing on your next cron run.</p>

<h2>Optional: Indexing content retroactively</h2>

<p>Go to the main Drupal search settings page (<code>YOUR-DRUPAL-7-SITE.gov/admin/config/search/settings</code>) and click <code>Re-index site</code>. This will start sending us content for indexing on your next cron run. You can wait for cron to run, or you can run it manually. You can also adjust the number of documents sent to us in each cron run using the <code>throttle</code> setting on the Drupal search settings page.</p>

<h2>Having trouble?</h2>

<p>Take a look at our <a href="/manual/drupal-module-troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting tips</a>, and don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">reach out</a>. We're not Drupal experts ourselves, but we'll try to help.</p>

      <p>This documentation will walk you through setting up the <code>usasearch</code> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch/releases?api_version%5B%5D=7234">Drupal 8 module</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> field by field, to integrate your Drupal CMS with the DigitalGov Search service. If you have trouble, take a look at our <a href="/manual/drupal-module-troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting tips</a>.</p>

<p>These instructions follow the order of settings listed in our Drupal module at <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-8-SITE.gov/admin/config/search/usasearch</code>.</p>

<p>Instructions for setting up the <strong>Drupal 7</strong> module are <a href="/manual/drupal-7-module-instructions.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Search Settings</h2>

<p>This section allows you to configure how the <code>USA Search Block</code> will use our service. In Drupal 8, you must place the <code>USA Search Block</code>, as we do not override the native Drupal Search. We recommend you disable the native Drupal Search block.</p>

<h3>Site handle</h3>

<p>Required. Enter the site handle you gave your search site. This is found in our <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> > Your site > Dashboard > Settings.</p>

<h3>Enable autocomplete</h3>

<p>Recommended setting: Checked.</p>

<p>Check this box if you want to enable the Javascript for our <a href="/developer/">Type-ahead API</a>. Suggestions for popular queries will appear below your search box as searchers begin typing. A query must have been run more than 10 times in a day for it to become a search suggestion.</p>

<p>NOTE: Only change this setting if you have domain masking configured for your search site! If you haven’t set it up, leave the default <code>https://search.usa.gov</code> until you’ve completed the masking steps.</p>

<h2>Connecting Drupal to Our System for Direct Indexing</h2>

<p>Highly recommended! The “i14y API settings” section allows you to send content directly to our indexes via our i14y API. This means that you'll have full control over the content of your search results, and your search index will be updated in real time. Note: If you do not want to index your content with us yourselves, do not complete this section. If you only want to use our system for search, skip this section and the following Indexing section.</p>

<h3>Enable i14y API</h3>

<p>Recommended! If this box is checked, the module will send content to DigitalGov Search for indexing. The <code>Drawer Handle</code> and <code>API Secret Token</code> fields will be required.</p>

<h3>Drawer Handle</h3>

<p>Enter your i14y  "drawer handle”. This is the name you gave your drawer and is found in: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> > Your site > Manage Content > i14y Drawers.</p>

<h3>i14y API Secret Token</h3>

<p>Enter your i14y drawer’s “secret token”. This can be found in our system in: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> > Your site > Manage Content > i14y Drawers, select the option, <code>Show</code>.</p>

<h3>Content Types</h3>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Checked - all types.</p>

<p>Select which content types will be sent to our indexes. Content types unchecked here will <strong>not</strong> be indexed. You can also control indexing status of individual nodes in their DigitalGov Search settings.</p>

<p>If you exclude a content type from indexing, and later decide to <em>include</em> it, nodes of this type will be indexed on the next cron run. You may also want to review any nodes that were created in the interim, to ensure in their individual DigitalGov Search settings that they are enabled for indexing.</p>

<h3>Description View Mode</h3>

<p>Recommended setting: Teaser.</p>

<p>Select the search result description text that works best for your site. Choose among the text you’ve set as your teaser, RSS item content, Drupal search index snippet, or full text. The view mode  will need to be enabled and configured for each content type. If the view mode is not available for a content type, "Teaser" will be used. The full text of your node will still be searchable.</p>

<p>Note: If you don't like the content that's being sent to us as the Teaser, you can make changes for that content type's at <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-8-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/[CONTENT TYPE] &gt; Display settings</code> or
<code>YOUR-DRUPAL-8-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/[CONTENT TYPE]/display/teaser</code></p>

<h3>Enable i14y logging</h3>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Checked.</p>

<p>Check this box to log i14y API operations to the watchdog log. On <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-8-SITE.gov/admin/reports/dblog</code>, filter by Type <code>usasearch</code>.</p>

<h3>Alternate indexing domain</h3>

<p>Do you edit your site on one domain or subdomain, but publish on another? If so, use this field to set the domain you want us to present for your content on the search results page. For instance, if you enter <code>www.YOURAGENCY.gov</code> here, nodes that are stored in Drupal under <code>edit.YOURAGENCY.gov</code> would be indexed with us as <code>www.YOURAGENCY.gov</code>.</p>

<h2>Indexing</h2>

<h3>Re-index site</h3>

<p>If you click <code>re-index site</code>, we will begin a full-site reindexing on your next cron run. You can wait for cron to run, or you can run it manually.</p>

<h3>Number of items to index per cron run</h3>

<p>Use this throttle to adjust the number of documents sent to us in each cron run. The number that is best for your site will depend on various factors, including your firewall.</p>

<h2>Save configuration</h2>

<p>After you save these settings, the module will send a command to us when you hit <code>Save</code> on a node in Drupal, either to add the node to the index, update it, or delete it from the index.</p>

<h2>Having trouble?</h2>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>If you experience difficulty sending documents to our index via <a href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/developer/i14y.html">i14y</a>, it is possible your firewall is not letting you communicate with the i14y server. Adding a test document to your i14y drawer can help you diagnose a firewall issue.
Windows users may need to <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html">install cURL</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> in order to run this test from the command line.</p>

<h2>Adding the Test Document</h2>

<p>From the command line, enter:</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents" -XPOST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -u your_drawer_handle:your_secret_token -d '{"document_id":"1", "title":"Test Document", "path": "http://www.gov.gov/cms/doc1.html", "created": "2015-05-12T22:35:09Z", "description":"The summary of the document goes here.", "content":"This is placeholder text, and in a real document would be paragraphs long.", "promote": false, "language" : "en", "tags" : "tag1, another tag"}'
</code></pre>

<p>Note: you need to replace <strong>your_drawer_handle</strong> with your i14y drawer handle, found in the i14y drawers section in the Search Admin Center (<a href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > i14y Drawers). You will also need to replace <strong>your_secret_token</strong> with the drawer’s secret token, which can be found by hitting “Show” in the 14y drawer list. The drawer handle and token should be separated by a colon (:) with no spaces on either side of the colon.</p>

<p>The above command returns JSON structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
"status":200,
"developer_message":"OK",
"user_message":"Your document was successfully created."
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you do not see a 200 status, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">contact our team</a>.</p>

<p>After successfully sending a document, you should see an increase (by 1) in the number of documents in your <a href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/i14y-drawers.html">i14y drawer</a>.</p>

<h2>Removing the Test Document</h2>

<p>Once you have successfully added the test document to your drawer, you will need to delete it, or it will appear in your site’s search results.</p>

<p>From the command line, enter:</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents/1" -XDELETE -u your_drawer_handle:your_secret_token
</code></pre>

<p>The above command returns JSON structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
"status":200,
"developer_message":"OK",
"user_message":"Your document was successfully deleted."
}
</code></pre>
