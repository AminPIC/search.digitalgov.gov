<p>The Referrers report shows what pages searchers were on when they entered their queries. The current month is shown by default, and the date can be adjusted by using the date selectors at the top of the page and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site's visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.</p>

<p>Data are available in the Admin Center from August 2014 (13 months).</p>

<h2>Top Referrers</h2>

<p>The top 1,000 most popular referring URLs for your selected time period, with the most popular listed first.</p>

<h2># of Queries</h2>

<p>The number of queries made from a specific referring URL.</p>

<h2>View All Queries from this Referring URL</h2>

<p>Click on the link to see a list of all the queries  that were made from a specific URL, with the most popular listed first (the <strong>Queries from a Referring URL</strong> report). You can see the number of times each query was made from that URL. You can also click to view a list of all the referring URLs for each unique query (the <strong>Referring URLs Leading to a Query</strong> report).</p>

      <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">How to View a Snapshot of What's Happening on Your Site Today</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Dashboard > Site Overview</p>

<p>The Site Overview page provides a snapshot of what has been happening on your site in the past day. All of the analytics in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> are updated in real-time, which means that you instantaneously see the searches and clicks as they're performed on your site.</p>

<p>You can opt to receive this snapshot as a daily email by clicking on the envelope icon (<i class="icon-envelope"></i>) in the top navigation bar next to your selected site.</p>

<p>You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site's visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.</p>

<h2>Top Queries</h2>

<p>Reports on the top 10 searches done by searchers on your site. If you don't have any searches, you'll see a message that there aren't enough query data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.</p>

<p>Note that the data are processed to present "real" searches by humans (that is, the data are de-duped by IP address to remove bot traffic and other noise).</p>

<h2>Top Clicked URLs</h2>

<p>Reports on the top 10 pages that were clicked thru by searchers on your search results page. If you don't have any clicks, you'll see a message that there aren't enough click data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.</p>

<h2>Trending URLs</h2>

<p>If there are any pages that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing URLs that were <em>visited by users on your website</em>.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular pages on your website. Investigate why pages are trending, if the reason is not immediately apparent.</p>

<p>Note that you'll only see this list of trending URLs if you have our <a href="/manual/code.html">Javascript snippet</a> on your web pages. Data are updated every few minutes so this is near real-time information and you may see URLs come and go quickly.</p>

<h2>Trending Queries</h2>

<p>If there are any queries that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing search terms with the greatest <em>gain</em> between yesterday and today.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular terms. Create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete.</p>

<h2>Queries with No Results</h2>

<p>If there are any terms that returned no results, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 queries with no results.</p>

<p>For example, on one agency's website in October 2012, a dozen searches for <em>frostline</em> returned no results. The frost line&mdash;also known as depth of frost or freezing&mdash;is the depth to which the groundwater in soil is expected to freeze. The agency's pages on the topic referred to this concept as <em>depth of freezing</em>.</p>

<p>Use this alert about results data to help searchers find your content by adding a <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bet</a>, updating your existing web pages, or both.</p>

<h2>Top Queries with Low Click Thrus</h2>

<p>If there are any frequently searched terms that returned results but didn't result in a click at least 20% of the time, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 searches with low click thru rates.</p>

<p>Use this alert about low click thrus to identify issues with coverage. You may opt to create a <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bet (Text or Graphics)</a>, add pages that may be missing from the results, or do both to improve recall. Or, you may opt to incorporate language from these popular search terms into your titles and descriptions to improve the relevance of results, or enter common search terms as keywords, verbatim.</p>

<h2>This Month's Totals to Date</h2>

<p>Reports on the total number of queries and clicks for the present month-to-date. A click  is recorded each time a searcher clicks on a results link.</p>

<p>A graph of your site's total search queries over time is also presented to provide an overview of how your traffic has trended from the time your agency started using our service (but no further back than 2010). Hover over the trend line to see the total number of queries in previous months.</p>

      <p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Analytics > Monthly Reports</p>

<p>The monthly report gives a bird's-eye view of the number of <a href="/manual/queries.html">queries</a> and <a href="/manual/clicks.html">clicks</a> each month.</p>

<p>Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site's visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.</p>

<p>Data are available in the Admin Center from August 2014.</p>

<h2>Monthly Usage Stats</h2>

<p>Data for the total number of queries and clicks. Use this report to find and analyze the so-called <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/analysis/long-tail.html">short head</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> of your most popular search queries and clicks, which are typically the same as your site's <a href="http://www.usability.gov/tags/task-analysis/">top tasks</a>.</p>

<h3>Queries with No Results</h3>

<p>A list of queries that returned no results. Sometimes searchers look for information on the wrong website, and sometimes they use different words than what are used on the page, and so they get no results from the search index. Use this list of Queries with No Results to help searchers get to the information they're looking for. You can set up <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets (Text or Graphics)</a>), or a <a href="/manual/routed-queries.html">Routed Query</a>. You can also <a href="/manual/no-results.html">customize the No Results message</a> displayed on your results page.</p>

<h2>Impressions and Clicks by Module</h2>

<p>Detailed data for the total number of impressions and clicks and your clickthru rate (CTR) are presented for each "module" on the search results page. We also provide the average CTR across all DigitalGov Search customers so you can see how your rate compares to the average rate. The data in the table is sorted in descending order from the most to least number of clicks.</p>

<p>Use this report to inform which <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">modules you opt to display</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Drill down into best bets.</em></strong> Select the option to drill down into your <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets (Text or Graphics)</a> to see the number of impressions, number of clicks, and CTR for each best bet. The data in the table is sorted in descending order from the highest to lowest CTR. Review and edit best bets as needed. Focus on those with a high number of impressions and low CTR to make the biggest impact on searchers' experience (and on your overall CTR). Select drill down again to see a pie chart of the search terms that led to an impression on each best bet.</p>

<h2>Download Top Queries</h2>

<p>View a detailed report of the number of times searchers have input specific terms and phrases by clicking on the CSV (comma-separated values) link to download the list as a text file. Once you've downloaded the CSV file, you can easily <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-e8ab9ff3-be8d-43f1-9d52-b5e8a008ba5c">import it  into Excel</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> or another speadsheet program to analyze the data.</p>

<p>The CSV file contains three columns: (1) query, (2) raw count, and (3) IP-deduped.</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/10/24/understanding-your-users-needs-by-analyzing-search-terms/">Understanding Your Users' Needs By Analyzing Search Terms</a> for tips on how to create a semi-automated report for analyzing the data in this CSV file on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>All data presented on this page (and other pages in the Admin Center) are IP-deduped to exclude bots and other noise in an attempt to accurately represent searchers' intent on your site. Some definitions follow.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/manual/queries.html">Queries</a>:</strong> Number of times a search query (that is, a word or string of words) was entered in the search box by a unique searcher.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/manual/clicks.html">Clicks</a>.</strong> Number of times a searcher clicked on one of your pages within the search results for a particular query.</p>

<p><strong>Impressions:</strong> Number of times a module is displayed, whether it is clicked on or not. Not all modules are displayed for all queries. Each time a module is displayed it is counted as one impression.</p>

<p><strong>Clickthru Rate (CTR):</strong> The rate (expressed in a percentage) at which searchers click on a module. This rate is calculated by dividing the total number of clicks by the total number of impressions. CTR is useful to measure the performance of specific campaigns, such as <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">best bets</a> for seasonal events.</p>

<p><strong>Raw count:</strong> Total number of times the query was submitted. The raw count is provided in the downloadable CSV files only.</p>

<p><strong>IP-deduped count:</strong> Total number of times the query was submitted by any one IP address. This excludes bots and other traffic that send in a query multiple times from one IP address. It is often a more accurate representation of "real," human traffic.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> On the first of each month, we email you a report with data on the previous month's queries, clicks, and top search terms.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> The <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Site Overview</a> provides a snapshot of what has been happening on your site in the past day or so.</p>

<p>The Clicks page shows what searchers clicked on from your search results pages, and the number of times each of those items was clicked during the selected date range. The current month is shown by default, and the date can be adjusted using the date selectors at the top of the page and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site's visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.</p>

<p>Data are available in the Admin Center from August 2014 (13 months).</p>

<h2>Reading the Report Table</h2>

<h3>Top URLs Clicked</h3>

<p><a href="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/Analytics_Clicks_800.png" target="_blank" alt="Top clicks from results pages"><img style="float: right;" src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/Analytics_Clicks_175.png"></a>The top 1,000 most clicked-on URLs from your results page for the selected time period, with the most popular first.</p>

<h3>Download Details</h3>

<p>You can download the raw click logs for any URL in the list. The CSV (comma separated values) file has one line for each time this URL was clicked. Details avialable include:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Date</em> and <em>Time</em> of the click,</li>
<li><em>Query</em>: The query they ran before clicking the search result,</li>
<li><em>Position</em>: Where in the results page was the result they clicked, e.g. <strong>5</strong> means the searcher clicked the fifth result in the list,</li>
<li><em>Request</em>: The clicked URL (It is embedded in the request URL. Look for the text following ‘u=’.) and its position on the page,</li>
<li><em>Referrer</em>: The webpage the person was on when they ran the search, this column also includes the query,</li>
<li><em>Vertical</em> and <em>Modules</em>: The modules loaded in response to the query (Our <a href="/manual/module-codes.html">Module Codes</a> tip provides a key of the codes and names.),</li>
<li><em>Device</em>, <em>Browser</em>, and <em>OS</em>: The kind of device and browser they were using, and</li>
<li><em>Country Code</em> and <em>Region</em>: Where the user was, physically.</li>
</ul>


<h3># of Clicks</h3>

<p><a href="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/ClicksQueries_800.png" target="_blank" alt="Report of Queries that people ran before clicking on a particular page"><img style="float: right;" src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/ClicksQueries_175.png"></a>Select a hyperlinked number in the <code># of Clicks</code> column to view the queries that led to the clicks for that URL (the <strong>Queries leading to a Click</strong> report).</p>

<p>If you then click on a number in the <code># of Clicks</code> column for a query on the Queries leading to a Click page, you will see all the URLs <a href="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/ClicksfromQuery_800.png" target="_blank" alt="Report of pages people clicked on after searching for a given term"><img style="float: right;" src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/ClicksfromQuery_175.png"></a>that were clicked on from that query's results pages (the <strong>Clicks from a Query</strong> report). This is the same report you see when you follow a <code># of Clicks</code> link from the <a href="/manual/queries.html">Queries page</a>.</p>

<p>You can loop through or drill down into this list for any set of clicks and queries.</p>

<p>To customize your search results page and match your site's brand:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define your color scheme on the Fonts &amp; Colors page.</li>
<li>Upload your logo on the Image Assets page. (We'll also link your logo to your homepage using the homepage URL you provide on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page.)</li>
<li>Add your navigation links on the Header &amp; Footer page.</li>
</ol>


<p>Read our <a href="/blog/serp-redesign-tips.html">favorite tips</a> to see how other sites have customized their results pages and for some ideas on how to optimize the <a href="/blog/serp-redesign.html">newly redesigned results page</a> for your site.</p>

<h2>Font &amp; Colors</h2>

<p><strong>Font Family.</strong> Leave the default font as-is, or select your preferred font family.</p>

<p><strong>Color Scheme.</strong> Leave the default color scheme as-is, or select Custom to create a customized scheme. Customize the color of any page element by clicking on it and entering a valid three- or six-digit hex value. You can also pick a color by dragging your mouse inside the color picker window.</p>

<h2>Image Assets</h2>

<p><strong>Favicon.</strong> Provide the URL for your agency's favicon. (A <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/favicon/f/blfaqfavicon1.htm">favicon</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, short for favorites icon, is the small image associated with your website.)</p>

<p><strong>Logo.</strong> Use the Choose File option to upload the logo that you'd like to appear in the header of your results page. Click on the option, Mark Logo for Deletion, to delete an uploaded logo. There isn't a required dimension. That said, images less than 550 pixels wide and 100 pixels high tend to work best.</p>

<p>If you don't upload a logo, searchers will simply see the header, <em>Your Site Name</em>. We'll use the site name you provide on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Logo Alignment.</strong> Leave the logo center-aligned, or select Left to make it left-aligned or Right to make it right-aligned. (Right-aligned logos are typically used on sites with right-to-left <a href="/manual/settings.html">languages</a> like Arabic, Hebrew, and Urdu.)</p>

<p><strong>Logo Alt Text.</strong> Add alt text for your logo. If you don't add custom alt text, we'll use the site name you provide on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page as the default alt text.</p>

<h2>Header &amp; Footer</h2>

<p><strong>Tagline.</strong> Fill out text for a "tagline" if you'd like one to appear at the very top of your results page header.</p>

<p>The default tagline style uses Georgia (font family), 1.3 em (size), and italic (style). Email us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#x65;&#x61;&#x72;&#99;&#x68;&#64;&#115;&#x75;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#46;&#100;&#x69;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#x61;&#x6c;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;&#x2e;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;">&#115;&#x65;&#97;&#x72;&#99;&#x68;&#64;&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#46;&#100;&#x69;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#97;&#x6c;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;&#x2e;&#103;&#x6f;&#x76;</a> if you'd like to change the default font family, size, or style.</p>

<p><strong>Menu Button Alignment.</strong> Leave the Browse Site "hamburger" menu right-aligned, or select the Left option to make it left-aligned.</p>

<p><strong>Header and Footer Links.</strong> Fill out the titles and URLs for the navigation links you'd like to appear in your header and footer. You can add an email address by specifying <em>mailto:</em> within the URL field, such as:</p>

<p>Title: Contact us<br/>
URL: mailto:info@agency.gov</p>

<p>Use the icon with three horizontal lines on the left to change the order.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> As you change each font and color option, the mini search results page in the upper right-hand corner will update to reflect your changes. Once you click save, the changes will appear on your live site.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Our search results page uses a <a href="http://alistapart.com/topic/responsive-design">responsive design</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to ensure it is optimized for searchers anywhere, anytime, and on any device.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> We offer results through our Search Results API, if you'd like to create mash-ups or have complete control of the look and feel of your search results pages. You can access our Search Results API Instructions by clicking on the Activate Search option in the left-hand menu in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<p>You can add text to guide searchers to additional resources. If you leave this field blank, the Alternative Links will display immediately after the standard response.</p>

<h2>Alternative Links</h2>

<p>You can add links to alternative resources that may assist the searcher in answering their query. See, for instance, <a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=avinaweoinasdv">this search on USA.gov for "avinaweoinasdv"</a>.</p>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Manage Content > Routed Queries</p>

<p>Do you want to get searchers to a specific web page as quickly as possible? Create a Routed Query.</p>

<p>A routed query skips the search results page and automatically directs visitors to a web page of your choice for very specific queries. Use query routing to save visitors the extra step of reading through search results links by taking them directly to your content pages.</p>

<p>We recommend creating a routed query for <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/02/06/top-task-usability-design-for-your-users/">top tasks</a> that have a good content page but less-than-ideal search results.</p>

<h2>Add a Routed Query</h2>

<p><strong><em>Routed Query URL.</em></strong> Add the URL of the web page that you want to direct visitors to.</p>

<p><strong><em>Routed Query Description.</em></strong> Add a brief description to help you remember why you created this entry and what it does. Descriptions aren't used for indexing or visible to searchers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keywords.</em></strong> Add the specific words or phrases used to trigger the routing. Searchers will only be directed to the URL above when their query term exactly matches one of the listed keywords. Common keywords include synonyms, acronyms, compound words, misspellings, slang, or other variants. Enter each keyword (word or phrase up to 255 characters) in a separate field.</p>

<h2>Examples of How It Works</h2>

<p>Private industry has been using query routing for some time. If you go to <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/">Home Depot</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and search for a general term like <em>carpet</em>, you're routed to their carpet navigation page. If you search for a more specific term like <em>vanities</em>, you get standard search results.</p>

<p>Using Kids.gov an as example, every time someone goes to <a href="https://kids.usa.gov">Kids.gov</a> and searches for any of the following terms (must be exact matches), they'll automatically be directed to the Kids.gov <a href="https://kids.usa.gov/three-branches-of-government/index.shtml">Three Branches of Government</a> page.</p>

<ul>
<li>3 branches</li>
<li>3 branches of government</li>
<li>branches of government</li>
<li>executive branch</li>
<li>government branches</li>
<li>judicial branch</li>
<li>legislative branch</li>
<li>the three levels of government</li>
<li>three branches of government</li>
</ul>


<p>If they get routed to the <a href="https://kids.usa.gov/three-branches-of-government/index.shtml">Three Branches of Government</a> and search again for one of these terms, they'll get the standard list of search results. We won't take people in an endless loop.</p>

<p>If they search for something not on the above list, like <em>what are the branches of government</em>, they'll still get the normal search results.</p>

      <p>Our April 2015 training session looked into the nooks and crannies of the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>, and provided other advanced tips for optimizing your search. We used the scenario of a site redesign to ground these tips in a common experience. This is a summary and cheat sheet. Since we know that some of these tips won’t be relevant until they’re relevant, please hang on to this for future reference.</p>

<p>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Eg9LhhFcY">recorded session</a> on YouTube.</p>

<p>The launch of a new or redesigned site is a great time to think about refreshing your search as well. Come along on a journey through a search refresh before, during, and just after your new site goes live. You need not wait for a new site, though - these steps can be taken at any time.</p>

<h2>Tell Search Engines to (Re-)Index Your Site</h2>

<p>DigitalGov Search does not crawl. Crawling is hard and expensive, and others have systems in place that do this very well, so we rely on commercial search engines’ indexes of your site. Search engines create <strong>indexes</strong> of the websites they crawl, and search queries are run against those indexes. If a website is restructured but the search indexes are not updated, the old structure will be presented in search results.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Robots.txt</strong> files declare what can and cannot be indexed by crawlers. Tip: Set up a robots.txt file on your <em>beta</em> site to <em>disallow</em> indexing. When you switch your beta site to <strong>production</strong>, update the robots.txt to <strong>allow</strong> indexing. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=robots.txt+example">Resources and Examples</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>

<ul>
<li>Put your file at the root of your site, <code>http://www.YOURSITE.gov/robots.txt</code>.</li>
<li>If you didn’t disallow indexing of your beta site and it has already been indexed, request it be removed via Google and Bing’s webmaster tools sites. A robots.txt file won’t proactively <em>remove</em> content from search engines’ indexes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>301 redirects</strong> allow crawlers to find their way around your new structure, and expedite the reindexing process. A 404 page is a dead end, and the new location or version of that file can’t be found from there.

<ul>
<li>If the volume of 301s to place is daunting, consider setting a general 301 for all the content in a location pointing to the new index page for that type of content. You can also prioritize your 301 placement based on your site usage analytics, starting with the most popular pages.</li>
<li>If you’re not sure which of your pages are throwing 404s, you can run your list of URLs through an <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=http+status+checker">online http status checker</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, or you could install SEO auditing software on your computer, if your IT policies allow it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>XML sitemaps</strong> tell crawlers how often to reindex your site, or portions of your site. The protocol and examples are available at [Sitemaps.org(http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html)&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. The crucial element is to set the <code>&lt;changefreq&gt;</code> tag to the appropriate frequency for your content. You can set the frequency at the site, folder, or even individual item level.

<ul>
<li>Put your file at the root of your site, <code>http://www.YOURSITE.gov/sitemap.xml</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>And, Tell Us about Your Content and We’ll Index It Directly</h2>

<p>While we don’t crawl, we will index any pages you tell us about. The steps mentioned above will be useful for searchers out on the web looking for your information and services. By default we leverage the commercial indexes for your site search, but we have our own indexes as well.  If you’re having a hard time getting search engines to index your new site, re-index your old site, or you just prefer our indexes, there are a couple of ways you can tell us about your content.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="/manual/rss.html"><strong>send us all of your content</strong> via RSS</a> for direct indexing. We’ll need the URL, title, description, update date, and the full content or body of each item. Sort by update date in descending order. This can be an RSS or Atom feed. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Let us know</a> you created this feed. There are a few different options for indexing feeds so we’ll make sure it’s set up in the best way possible.</li>
<li>Better yet, <strong>publish your content via API</strong>. We are in the beginning stages of development for a bootstrap API and a CRUD API. If you’d like to be part of our beta testing group and give feedback on the product, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">let us know</a>. We want to get people kicking the tires on the prototype early, in the coming weeks. (note, this is current as of April 2015)</li>
</ul>


<p><a name="ac"></a></p>

<h2>Update Your Search Settings in the Admin Center</h2>

<p>Don’t forget to update your content settings in the Admin Center to point to your new content. This is an important, but often overlooked step.</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up your domains list to <strong>include entire domains</strong>. Example: nih.gov - not www.nih.gov. Specifying www will limit your search to that particular subdomain. If you do specify a subdomain, do so with the intent to limit your search. <a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > <code>YourSite</code> > <code>Content</code> > <code>Domains</code></li>
<li>If a particular <strong>new item</strong> is not showing up in search results and you need it there ASAP, you can create a Best Bet pointing to it, or add it as a Supplemental URL.

<ul>
<li><strong>Best Bets</strong> can be managed at <a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > <code>YourSite</code> > <code>Content</code> > <code>Best Bets: Text or Best Bets: Graphics</code> <em>(Recommended)</em></li>
<li><strong>Supplemental URLs</strong> can be added at <a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > <code>YourSite</code> > <code>Content</code> > <code>Domains</code> > <code>Advanced</code> > <code>Supplemental URLs</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When undergoing a <a href="/blog/redesign.html">site redesign</a>, be sure to <strong>update</strong> Collections, Best Bets, RSS Feeds, Header and Footer links, related sites, image assets, and results page colors, as appropriate.</li>
<li>If you set up a <strong>test search site</strong> to go with your beta site, we recommend you <strong>transfer</strong> all the new settings over to your old site when you take your beta site into production, in order to maintain continuity of analytics. The test search site will have separate analytics from your existing, live search. If you would like help transferring your settings, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">let us know</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Break Glass In Case of Emergency</h2>

<p>We have a stopgap measure available to <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">filter certain results</a> directly in the Admin Center. Under <code>[DigitalGov Search](/index.html) &gt; [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) &gt; YourSite &gt; Analytics &gt; Queries</code> you’ll see an option for Filter URLs.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note!</strong> This is meant to be a <strong>stopgap measure</strong> until search engines’ indexes have caught up. After they’re updated there, the urls you’ve filtered here <strong>should be removed</strong>. They are appended to your query and are counted against the byte limit we can include in any one query. Please don’t forget to remove them after you no longer need them.</p>

<p><a name="fancy"></a></p>

<h2>Get Fancy</h2>

<p>At any time, you can use some of our more advanced options to get the most out of your search. Don’t wait for a redesign to take advantage of these features.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>3rd party tracking</strong> allows you to include search traffic in your broader website and customer experience monitoring, such as Google Analytics and Foresee.

<ul>
<li>If you are sending <strong>more than one code</strong>, or an additional code, for a given tracking service, please either send both together in the same submission, or include a note with your second code snippet that it should be appended to what you had submitted before.</li>
<li><strong>ForeSee</strong> requires you set up a <a href="/manual/cname.html">cname</a> in order for it to work (see below).</li>
<li>You can also put in any other analytics or customer satisfaction tools you use.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> is already integrated with DigitalGov Search, so you don’t need to do anything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Domain Masking</strong> is available for your hosted search results page. Create a <strong>CNAME</strong> record in your external DNS records. Example: <code>NAME: search.YOURSITE.gov</code> ; <code>CNAME: search.usa.gov.edgekey.net</code>. Other subdomain options are ‘find’ and ‘findit.’ <strong>Alert us in writing</strong> of your choice and we’ll get our side set up. When both sides are ready, <strong>update the form code</strong> on your search box to point to <code>search.YOURSITE.gov</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Search box setup</strong>. You can get fancy with your search box, pointing it to a particular collection, or adding options for people to set their search scope.

<ul>
<li>Start your <strong>search in a collection</strong>: add <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="INSERT_COLLECTION_ID_#" /&gt;</code> to your form code. The collection ID can be found in the URL of the collection’s edit screen.</li>
<li>Create an <strong>isolated search</strong> experience by searching a hidden collection: add <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="INSERT_COLLECTION_ID_#" /&gt;</code>, as above, but make sure the collection display is set to OFF.</li>
<li>Provide <strong>options</strong> that allow the user to set their search scope from the get-go. For example, <a href="http://lawrenceks.org/">Lawrence, Kansas</a> has developed a nice modern approach to radio buttons.</li>
<li>Pass a <strong>site limit parameter</strong> from your search box: add <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="sitelimit" id="sitelimit" value="http://www.agency.gov/limittothisfolder"&gt;</code> to your form code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>API key</strong> for displaying search results on your own site is available under <a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > <code>YourSite</code> > <code>Activate</code> > <code>API Access Key</code>. We recommend you <strong>use the hosted results page</strong> whenever possible, to take advantage of all of the features of our service.</li>
