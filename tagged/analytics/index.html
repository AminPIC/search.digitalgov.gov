      <p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Analytics > 3rd Party Tracking</p>

<p>Do you want your search results page to run third-party web services such as Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, Siteimprove, or WebTrends?</p>

<p>Input the JavaScript code you'd like to call from your search results page. Click submit to send us your request. We'll input your code for you and send you an email to confirm that we've done it.</p>

<p>Some tips for commonly used third-party web services follow.</p>

<h2>Google Analytics Tip</h2>

<p>Within your Google Analytics account, select the option, <em>Do Track Site Search</em>. Set the query parameter as <em>query</em>. For more information, read Google's tip, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012264?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1031951">Set Up and Configure Site Search</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you've requested <a href="cname.html">domain masking</a> and you want to include the analytics for your <em>search.agency.gov</em> subdomain with your main <em>agency.gov</em> domain, you'll need to set your domain in your Google Analytics JavaScript by including <code>_gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'agency.gov']);</code>.</p>

<p>For more information, read Google's tip, <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite">Tracking Multiple Domains</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>The code you submit should look something like one of the following two scripts.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics Code (Older Format)</h3>

<pre><code> &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 var _gaq = _gaq || []; 
 _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-########-1']); 
 _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

 (function() { 
 var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; 
 ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl'; : 'http://www') +      '.google-analytics.com/ga.js'; 
 var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s); 
 })();
 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Google Analytics Code (Newer Format)</h3>

<pre><code> &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Digital Analytics Program Tip</h2>

<p>Does your federal agency participate in the <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> (DAP)?  You don't need to do anything. We're already fully integrated with DAP.</p>

<h2>ForeSee Tip</h2>

<p>Coordinate with your ForeSee representative and DigitalGov Search to implement your customer satisfaction survey on your results page. The four general steps follow.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x73;&#x65;&#x61;&#x72;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x2e;&#100;&#x69;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#97;&#x6c;&#x67;&#111;&#118;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;">&#x73;&#x65;&#x61;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#x2e;&#100;&#105;&#x67;&#x69;&#x74;&#97;&#108;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;&#x2e;&#x67;&#111;&#118;</a> to <a href="cname.html">set up a CNAME</a> for search.youragency.gov.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the files path in your Foresee code to use an absolute path instead of a relative path.</p>

<p> <strong>Find =></strong> 'files': '/fsrscripts/',</p>

<p> <strong>and replace it with =></strong> 'files': '//www.youragency.gov/fsrscripts/',</p>

<p> <em>(Or, find => 'files': '/foresee/', and replace it with => 'files': '//www.youragency/foresee/',)</em></p>

<p> in the following five files.</p>

<ul>
<li>foresee-trigger.js</li>
<li>foresee-tracker.js</li>
<li>foresee-alive.js</li>
<li>foresee-qualifier.js</li>
<li>foresee-test.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Submit your foresee-trigger.js via our Admin Center. It should look something like the following script. <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.youragency.gov/library/foresee/foresee-trigger.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>We'll send you an email to confirm that we've set up both your CNAME and added the script for your foresee-trigger.js file.</p></li>

<p>All of the analytics in the Admin Center are updated in real-time, which means that you  instantaneously see the searches and clicks that are performed on your site.</p>

<p>You see filtered data by default. You can toggle between a filtered or unfiltered view.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filtered.</strong> Several rules are applied to remove bot and other non-human looking traffic. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site's visitors.</li>
<li><strong>Unfiltered.</strong> Nearly all searches and clicks are included. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded. Some of you may see dramatically more data in the unfiltered view.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> The option to view (un)filtered data is a per-user, "sticky" setting. It applies to you only (not any other users on your agency's account). It applies across all of your sites (not just the site you're currently viewing).</p>

      <p>On June 10, 2014, the Metrics Community of Practice of the Federal Web Managers Council and <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/digitalgov-university/">DigitalGov University</a> hosted an event to honor the memory of Joe Pagano, a former co-chair of the Web Metrics Sub-Council.</p>

<p>This third lecture honoring Joe focused on search engine optimization (SEO).</p>

<p>While commercial search engines do a remarkable job of helping the public find our government information, as web professionals, it's also our job to help the public make sense of what they find.</p>

<p>Ammie Farraj Feijoo, our program manager, presented on SEO for government websites and specifically talked about:</p>

<ul>
<li>What SEO is and why it is important;</li>
<li>SEO building blocks for writing content;</li>
<li>Conducting keyword research; and</li>
<li>Eliminating ROT (redundant, outdated, and trivial content).</li>

    <h1>
      <a href="/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html">I Didn't Try to Grow a Bigger Ox:  How I Found Hadoop</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>A year ago I rolled my first Hadoop system into production. Since then, I've spoken to quite a few people who are eager to try Hadoop themselves in order to solve their own big data problems. Despite having similar backgrounds and data problems, few of these people have sunk their teeth into Hadoop. When I go to Hadoop Meetups in San Francisco, I often meet new people who are evaluating Hadoop and have yet to launch a cluster. Based on my own background and experience, I have some ideas on why this is the case.</p>

<p>I studied computer science in school and have worked on a wide variety of computer systems in my career, with a lot of focus on server-side Java. I learned a bit about building distributed systems and working with large amounts of data when I built a pay-per-click (PPC) ad network in 2004. The system is still in operation and at one point was handling several thousand searches per second. As the sole technical resource on the system, I had to educate myself very quickly about how to scale up.</p>

<p>As I contemplated how doomed I would be should traffic levels increase much more, I remember wondering to myself, "How does Google deal with all that data?" The answer came to me in the form of the Google File System (GFS) paper and later the MapReduce paper, both from Google. It dawned on me that because Google was forced to solve a much larger problem, they had come up with an elegant solution for a whole range of more modest data problems running on commodity hardware. But it wouldn't be until 2010 that I would get to work with this technology firsthand.</p>

<p>As I wrote in an <a href="/blog/adopting-hadoop.html">earlier article</a>, I started re-architecting DigitalGov Search, the U.S. government's search system, in 2009 based on a solution stack of free, open source software including Ruby on Rails, Solr, and MySQL. A wave of déja vu hit me as I started worrying about what to do with the growing mountain of data piling up in MySQL and our increasing need to analyze it in different ways. I had heard that a new company called Cloudera, founded by some big data people from Yahoo!, Google, and Facebook, was making Hadoop available for the masses in a reliable distribution, much in the same way that RedHat did for Linux. Curiosity got the best of me and I bought the newly minted <em>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</em> from O'Reilly. The most insightful part of the book to me was the very first sentence. It's a quote from Grace Hopper: "In pioneer days, they used oxen for heavy pulling, and when one ox couldn't budge a log, they didn't try to grow a bigger ox." I didn't want to grow a bigger server; I wanted to harness a bunch of small servers together to work in unison. The more I learned the more curious I got, so I started reading more. And that's when I hit my first roadblock.</p>

<p>I think people who have been working with Hadoop technologies for years and years sometimes forget just how rich and diverse the big data software ecosystem has become, and how daunting it can be to folks approaching it for the first time. When people at the Meetups say they are evaluating solutions to their data scaling problem, the answers they hear sound something like this: "Just use Hadoop Hive Pig Mahout Avro HBase Cassandra Oozie Sqoop Flume ZooKeeper Cascading NoSQL RCFile. Oh, almost forgot…cloud."</p>

<p>The thought of wading through all of that just to learn about what I needed to learn about was a bit too overwhelming for me, so I put the whole matter aside for a few months. Over time, I started to dive into each of these projects to understand the primary use case, how active the developer community was and which organizations were using it in production. I converged on the idea of using Hive as a warehouse for our data. I opted for Cloudera's distribution since I wanted to reduce the risk of running into compatibility issues between all the various subsystems. Having tracked down anomalies in a highly multi-threaded and contentious distributed Java system before, I liked the idea of someone else taking on that problem for me.</p>

<p>At some point, I had read everything I could read and grew impatient to get my hands dirty, so I decided to just download CDH3 on my laptop and give it a try. The tutorial instructions for the standalone version worked, and I successfully computed more digits of pi than I ever thought I'd need. After creating some sample data in Hive and running a few queries, I felt pretty confident that Hive would be the right tool for the job. I just needed to find somewhere to install and run HDFS (namenode, secondary namenode, and data nodes), Hadoop (jobtracker and tasktracker nodes), Hive, and Hue for a nice front end to it all.</p>

<p>I knew from my past experience how to stretch the limits of CPU, disk, IO, and memory on commodity servers, and I identified a few potential servers at our primary datacenter with resources I figured I could leverage. Once again I followed the tutorial instructions, this time for the fully distributed version of CDH3, and once again I started to compute pi. And that's when I hit my second roadblock. It took me a few days to figure out that I had a problem with DNS. Each machine needs to be able to resolve every other machine's name and IP in the cluster. Whether you do that via /etc/hosts or a local DNS server is up to you, but it needs to happen or the whole thing gets wedged. Once I got that sorted out, everything just started falling into place and I had Hive working in production within a few days. A week later, I started pulling out the MySQL jobs and deleting big tables, and that's been the trend ever since.</p>

<p>Over time, I've gone on to learn about using custom Ruby mappers in Hive, moving data back and forth between MySQL and Hive with Sqoop, and getting the data into HDFS in real-time with Flume. All of these components from the Cloudera distribution are working nicely in our production environment now, and I sleep well at night knowing I have such a solid, deliberate plan for growth. My initial investment in learning about the Hadoop ecosystem is really paying dividends, but when I think about all those people at the Meetups stuck in evaluation mode, I feel their pain. Does it have to be such a struggle?</p>

<p>The big challenge in my opinion is not that any one piece of the puzzle is too difficult. Any reasonably smart (or in my case stubborn) engineer can set themselves on the task of learning about a new technology once they know that it needs to be learned. The challenge with the Hadoop ecosystem is that it presents the newbie with the meta-problem of figuring out which of these tools are appropriate for their use case at all, and whether or not to even consider the problem today versus deferring it until later. In a way Facebook has it easy, because when you are adding 15TB of data per day, that decision is pretty much made for you.</p>

<p>For all the companies sitting in the twilight between the gigabyte and the petabyte who don't have Hadoop expertise in-house, there is a collection of free information to help guide people to the right solution space (Hadoop Tutorial, White Papers). These days, when I talk to people who are evaluating solutions to their big data problems, my advice to them is to break down their problems into a few discrete use cases and then work on ferreting out the technologies that are designed for that use case. Get a proof of concept to demonstrate that the technology can address your use case and convince yourself and others that you're on the right track. Work toward putting something simple into production. Lather, rinse, and repeat. I am still in that cycle myself, as these days I'm exploring HBase and OpenTSDB to give me low-latency access to time series data and Mahout to do frequent item set mining, but that's another article for another day.</p>

      <p><a href="/index.html">DigitalGov Search</a> > <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> > YourSite > Analytics > Monthly Reports</p>

<p>The monthly report gives a bird's-eye view of the number of <a href="/manual/queries.html">queries</a> and <a href="/manual/clicks.html">clicks</a> each month.</p>

<p>Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>Data start from the time your agency started using our service (but no further back than 2009).</p>

<h2>Monthly Usage Stats</h2>

<p>Data for the total number of queries and clicks. Use this report to find and analyze the so-called <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/analysis/long-tail.html">short head</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> of your most popular search queries and clicks, which are typically the same as your site's <a href="http://www.usability.gov/tags/task-analysis/">top tasks</a>.</p>

<h2>Impressions and Clicks by Module</h2>

<p>Detailed data for the total number of impressions and clicks and your clickthru rate (CTR) are presented for each "module" on the search results page. We also provide the average CTR across all DigitalGov Search customers so you can see how your rate compares to the average rate. The data in the table is sorted in descending order from the most to least number of clicks.</p>

<p>Use this report to inform which <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">modules you opt to display</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Drill down into best bets.</em></strong> Select the option to drill down into your <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bets:Text</a> or <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">Best Bets: Graphics</a> to see the number of impressions, number of clicks, and CTR for each best bet. The data in the table is sorted in descending order from the highest to lowest CTR. Review and edit best bets as needed. Focus on those with a high number of impressions and low CTR to make the biggest impact on searchers' experience (and on your overall CTR). Select drill down again to see a pie chart of the search terms that led to an impression on each best bet.</p>

<h2>Download Top Queries</h2>

<p>View a detailed report of the number of times searchers have input specific terms and phrases by clicking on the CSV (comma-separated values) link to download the list as a text file. Once you've downloaded the CSV file, you can easily <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-HP010342598.aspx">import it  into Excel</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> or another speadsheet program to analyze the data.</p>

<p>The CSV file contains three columns: (1) query, (2) raw count, and (3) IP-deduped.</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/10/24/understanding-your-users-needs-by-analyzing-search-terms/">Understanding Your Users' Needs By Analyzing Search Terms</a> for tips on how to create a semi-automated report for analyzing the data in this CSV file on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>All data presented on this page (and other pages in the Admin Center) are IP-deduped to exclude bots and other noise in an attempt to accurately represent searchers' intent on your site. Some definitions follow.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/manual/queries.html">Queries</a>:</strong> Number of times a search query (that is, a word or string of words) was entered in the search box by a unique searcher.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/manual/clicks.html">Clicks</a>.</strong> Number of times a searcher clicked on one of your pages within the search results for a particular query.</p>

<p><strong>Impressions:</strong> Number of times a module is displayed, whether it is clicked on or not. Not all modules are displayed for all queries. Each time a module is displayed it is counted as one impression.</p>

<p><strong>Clickthru Rate (CTR):</strong> The rate (expressed in a percentage) at which searchers click on a module. This rate is calculated by dividing the total number of clicks by the total number of impressions. CTR is useful to measure the performance of specific campaigns, such as <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">best bets</a> for seasonal events.</p>

<p><strong>Raw count:</strong> Total number of times the query was submitted. The raw count is provided in the downloadable CSV files only.</p>

<p><strong>IP-deduped count:</strong> Total number of times the query was submitted by any one IP address. This excludes bots and other traffic that send in a query multiple times from one IP address. It is often a more accurate representation of "real," human traffic.</p>

<h2>Top Queries</h2>

<p>Reports on the top 10 searches done by searchers on your site. If you don't have any searches, you'll see a message that there aren't enough query data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.</p>

<p>Note that the data are processed to present "real" searches by humans (that is, the data are de-duped by IP address to remove bot traffic and other noise).</p>

<h2>Top Clicked URLs</h2>

<p>Reports on the top 10 pages that were clicked thru by searchers on your search results page. If you don't have any clicks, you'll see a message that there aren't enough click data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.</p>

<h2>Trending URLs</h2>

<p>If there are any pages that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing URLs that were <em>visited by users on your website</em>.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular pages on your website. Investigate why pages are trending, if the reason is not immediately apparent.</p>

<p>Note that you'll only see this list of trending URLs if you have our <a href="/manual/code.html">Javascript snippet</a> on your web pages. Data are updated every few minutes so this is near real-time information and you may see URLs come and go quickly.</p>

<h2>Trending Queries</h2>

<p>If there are any queries that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing search terms with the greatest <em>gain</em> between yesterday and today.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular terms. Create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete.</p>

<h2>Queries with No Results</h2>

<p>If there are any terms that returned no results, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 queries with no results.</p>

<p>For example, on one agency's website in October 2012, a dozen searches for <em>frostline</em> returned no results. The frost line&mdash;also known as depth of frost or freezing&mdash;is the depth to which the groundwater in soil is expected to freeze. The agency's pages on the topic referred to this concept as <em>depth of freezing</em>.</p>

<p>Use this alert about results data to help searchers find your content by adding a <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bet</a>, updating your existing web pages, or both.</p>

<h2>Top Queries with Low Click Thrus</h2>

<p>If there are any frequently searched terms that returned results but didn't result in a click at least 20% of the time, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 searches with low click thru rates.</p>

<p>Use this alert about low click thrus to identify issues with coverage. You may opt to create a <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bet: Text</a> or <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">Best Bet: Graphics</a>, add pages that may be missing from the results, or do both to improve recall. Or, you may opt to incorporate language from these popular search terms into your titles and descriptions to improve the relevance of results.</p>

<h2>This Month's Totals to Date</h2>

<p>Reports on the total number of queries and clicks for the present month-to-date. A click  is recorded each time a searcher clicks on a results link.</p>

<p>A graph of your site's total search queries over time is also presented to provide an overview of how your traffic has trended from the time your agency started using our service (but no further back than 2010). Hover over the trend line to see the total number of queries in previous months.</p>

      <a href="/blog/award-big-data.html">DigitalGov Search Wins Government Big Data Solutions Award</a>
    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <p>DigitalGov Search (formerly USASearch) is the <a href="http://ctolabs.com/gsa-usasearch-wins-2011-government-big-data-solutions-award">winner of the 2011 Government Big Data Solutions Award</a>, announced at <a href="http://www.hadoopworld.com">Hadoop World</a> in New York City on November 8, 2011.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ctolabs.com/big-data-award">Big Data Award</a> was established to highlight innovative solutions and to facilitate the exchange of best practices, lessons learned, and creative ideas for addressing Big Data challenges. The Award judges saw DigitalGov Search as a great example of solving Big Data problems to improve government agility and to provide better service for less.</p>

<p>In line with the GSA's cost-saving "build once, use many times" paradigm, DigitalGov Search provides hosted search services for <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and hundreds of other government websites. This is done in a cost-effective way, especially for the agencies involved, which receive these services at no cost.</p>

<p>From the Award presentation:</p>

<blockquote><p>The GSA is to be congratulated for their mission-focused, citizen-centered, open approach to a big data challenge and a resulting solution that improves the experience of a broad swath of users of federal services. On behalf of our judges and the many citizens who use this capability on a daily basis we say thank you, and congratulations on this well deserved recognition.</p></blockquote>
