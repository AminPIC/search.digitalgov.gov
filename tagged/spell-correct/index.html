    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <blockquote>
<p><em>Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey. A kiddle dee divey too, wouldn&#8217;t you?</em></p>
</blockquote>


<p>These are the lyrics to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dny_JDlwGFM">novelty song</a> popular many years ago. It was supposedly written by the amused father of a toddler who was trying to sing something she had heard at nursery school: <em>Mares eat oats and does eat oats, and little lambs eat ivy. A kid will eat ivy too, wouldn&#8217;t you?</em></p>


<p>In the decades since, there have been various possible spellings of the first word, e.g. <em>marezy, marizy, maresee</em>. Sometimes the lyrics have been written out with no spaces, e.g. <em>Mareseedoatsandoezeedoats</em>…</p>


<p>This illustrates, in the extreme, how difficult it can be for visitors to your website to construct a search when they are not sure how a word is spelled or punctuated. They know they’ll recognize it if they see it, but first they would like a clue.</p>


<p>You can use the <a href="/blog/how-to-implement-type-ahead-search.html">Type-ahead</a> feature in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/affiliates/home">Admin Center</a> to help with misspellings. It augments spell check, and often cuts out that step.</p>


<p>Sometimes it is easy to map misspellings to the correct spelling, e.g. <em>acadamy, accademy</em> map to <em>academy</em>, but you may also want to keep variant forms of a word, e.g. <em>labor, labour </em>rather than treat them as misspellings.</p>


<p>You cannot correct for words that are misspellings only in context, e.g. <em>hilary </em>and <em>hillary</em> are individually correct words, but may not be in a particular phrase, e.g. <em>tropical storm hillary</em> (correct form is with one &#8216;l&#8217;) or <em>hilary rodham clinton</em> (correct form is with two &#8216;l&#8217;s&#8217;). So you should not globally map <em>hilary </em>to <em>hillary </em>or a lot of good searches will be turned bad. Since you can map only individual words, and not specific phrases in the type-ahead tool, an exclusion of one form altogether by mapping it to the other form may or may not work for your particular index.</p>


<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t know which word is being misspelled. Is <em>seceed </em>a misspelling of <em>succeed </em>or <em>secede</em>? You may leave it be, or make your best guess only to find out later you were wrong. It helps to search a seemingly misspelled word; it can turn out to be completely correct, even if unknown to you.</p>


<p>As in the words in the ditty above, words often evolve: <em>web site </em>or <em>website</em>; <em>email </em>or <em>e-mail</em>? Each form may retrieve different results.</p>


<p>Since these lists are built from what users search, there can be unacceptable terms that show up and must be deleted, such as ethnic slurs, profanity, and vulgarity. There are also areas of various shades of gray, depending on who your user population is and the focus of your site. For instance, blunt but accurate medical terms for bodily functions may be ok as suggestions for medical professionals, while their slang equivalents are not ok for children.</p>


<p>You can also anticipate searchers&#8217; needs by uploading groups of &#8220;evergreen&#8221; terms in advance of their showing up organically one by one. For instance, USA.gov uploaded all the names of the national parks, as they are heavily searched seasonally. Useful bulk uploads could be lists of jargon or scientific terms or something else. Make sure, however, that you have actual content for these terms. It is not a good search experience if the searcher finds the right term in the type-ahead suggestions list but it retrieves nothing useful.</p>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Some scholars have alleged that possibly Shakespeare, writing the above for his play Romeo and Juliet, was also slyly poking fun at the latrine-challenged rival theatre, The Rose, across the road from The Globe. There can be multiple intentions behind using a particular word, and the word itself may have several meanings, synonyms, and spelling variations.</p>


<p>In our query logs, for example, we have noticed that the term <em>immigration </em>has been misspelled with at least 20 variations, including: imagration, imegration, imergration,  imgration, imigation, imiigration, immagration, and so forth. </p>


<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/">Search.USA.gov</a> is the federal government portal for the whole country. We are serving people of different ages, different levels of education, different linguistic backgrounds, and people who may type hastily or just badly. We want people to have a good search experience, if we can help them figure out where they want to go with their queries.</p>


<p>Even if their 4th grade soccer coach was more bedazzling than their 4th grade spelling teacher, we don’t want our users bogged down at the beginning of their search with a spelling mistake if we can help them. Our goal is to get you to relevant results with as few detours as possible.  So, we have added several features to help the public navigate smoothly through a misspelled search query and on to a good search results page.</p>


<p>One feature we employ is a spell checker which detects possibly misspelled words by using a background dictionary to compare search words to.</p>


<p><img class="img-polaroid" class="img-polaroid" alt="Spelling override option for a search on imegration" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lpzfhhhH4b1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p>Notice in the above example that users are still allowed to tweak the contents of the search results and insist on just the results for <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=imegration"><em>imegration</em></a> if they want to.</p>


<p>Spell checkers have evolved over the years from concluding that a word that isn’t in the background dictionary must be a misspelling and then arbitrarily adjusting the search results presented, to allowing the possibility that the search query is actually correctly formed. Having a spell checker blunder in and correct something that isn’t incorrect can cause frustration if users find themselves in a fruitless loop of logical idiocy. For instance, <em>solr</em> is a common misspelling of <em>solar</em>, but it is also the name of an open-source search server.  The public can now override unhelpful spell checker guesses.</p>


<p>Another way of helping the public navigate from misspellings to the form of a word that will go to good results is type-ahead search. This feature suggests topics in a drop down box as the public types in the search box. Type-ahead search suggests popular queries for aspects of a topic, but also gently reroutes the public to the correct spelling of a word.</p>


<p><img class="img-polaroid" class="img-polaroid" alt="Type-ahead suggestion correcting the spelling of mortgage" src="http://f22818b4dfc10241d8a3-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.r31.cf2.rackcdn.com/tumblr_lpzfe9O7cl1qid15q.png"/></p>


<p><em>Morgage</em> is a very common misspelling of <em>mortgage</em>. Once the public types in most of the misspelled word, the editorially managed type-ahead search presents the correct spelling of the word, and then the most popular searches for <em>mortgage</em>.  Users can quickly browse the list and select what looks right. This is designed to present the public with the most likely search term which will then provide quick navigation to good search results. Users can also ignore the type-ahead search list, finish typing their own search query, and then click on Search and go to the results.</p>
